    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to argue that&nbsp;both&nbsp;“minor literature” and “small literature”&nbsp;should be readdressed&nbsp;as Michel Ragon’s “secondary zone literature”&nbsp;from three perspectives. Firstly, it will be argued that “minor and small literature” began to lose its theoretical capacity&nbsp;with the advent of globalization after the new millennium. Secondly, the problems of “minor literature” and “small literature” will be updated. “Minor literature”&nbsp;mainly has two problems: 1) &nbsp;The first feature of “minor literature”&nbsp;runs the risk of not only dismissing all literature written by minorities in “minor languages”, but also diminishing the possible meanings of the term, “minority”; and 2) The second and third characteristics of “minor literature”&nbsp;are unable to explain why only non-European arts&nbsp;are&nbsp;perceived to be political and collective. “Small literature”&nbsp;also has two problems: a) it fails to explain why countries that&nbsp;hardly qualify as ‘small’, face problems similar to those of “small literature” in the international literary context; and b) it does not have the capacity to explain the literature of minority and marginal groups within a nation or country. Thirdly, “minor and small literature” will be reconsidered as “secondary zone literature”, not only in an attempt to emphasize&nbsp;cultural dynamics and power relations based on the visibility of various “minor &amp; small” related literary works, but also to demonstrate that literature may be&nbsp;minor or small, but it always has quantitative implications",

The proposed \"secondary zone literature\" framework emphasizes cultural dynamics, power relations, and the quantitative implications of literary works."

The piece argues that removing genital expression from celibacy alters fundamental concepts of marital fidelity and celibacy.

Some diabetic patients use CAM, as well as conventional medicine, to maintain their health and control their blood sugar. This literature review aimed to 1) determine the prevalence of CAM used by patients with diabetes, summarize and evaluate the CAM use that includes: characteristics, patterns, types and reasons, 2) propose a conceptual model associated with CAM used by patients with diabetes. Systematic reviews were searched using an electronic database. The systematic reviews were published between 2005 and 2015 by using specific keywords. The number of systematic reviews obtained as a search result is 14 articles from 14 countries. The prevalence of CAM used by patients with diabetes ranged from 16.6% to 76%. Determinants associated with the CAM use were age, gender, family income, occupation, residence, and the characteristics of the disease, such as the length of time since diagnosed and complications. Most patients used CAM, along with the conventional treatment, and did not inform health professionals about the CAM use. The CAM use by patients with diabetes was relatively high and the confidence of patients believed the benefits of CAM. Therefore, integration with health professionals to develop CAM management is highly required",

Based on the premise that ‘All authors mediate reality through their writing...’ and taking into consideration that what we remember and how we remember is likely to have a significant impact on the narratives that we construct, this article considers the reliability of memory. It argues that whilst there is, at times, a blurring of boundaries between fact and fiction in Holocaust literature, this has little or no impact on the validity and authenticity of the narratives. In an attempt to address these issues more fully, this paper explores the notions of making meaning and meaning making, whilst considering the effects of positionality, time and trauma on memory. Key texts referred to in this discussion include Night (1958) by Elie Wiesel, All Rivers Run to the Sea (1996) by Elie Wiesel, In My Brother’s Shadow (2005) by Uwe Timm and The Dark Room (2001) by Rachel Seiffert. These texts have been chosen in order to highlight the subjectivity of memory and postmemory and to demonstrate the role that narrative plays in their construction and representation",

Juengst, an ordained minister and educator, proposes a tested year-long training process designed to equip individuals called to teach. The book emphasizes Christian education's purpose beyond mere instruction, focusing on \"traditioning\"—passing on the faith community's meaning to future generations, illuminating lives, and fostering spiritual development. The reviewer commends Juengst's program as a commendable plan of action for qualitative and effective teacher training, vital for mainline Protestantism's future."

    "summary": "This chapter examines how the American Civil War profoundly influenced children's literature, adapting existing forms and adding new moral and patriotic values to canonical strictures. Authors and publishers utilized books and magazines to help children understand the war's causes and progression, providing guidance for their responses. Prior to the war, children's literature emphasized self-improvement like temperance and piety, often focusing on racial differences rather than slavery's injustices. The post-war motto \"Fighting Against Wrong, and for the Good, the True, and the Beautiful\" from *The Little Corporal* exemplifies the blend of moral and patriotic urgency in children's writing. This analysis explores the evolution of themes and their impact on young readers during this turbulent period. Keywords: Children's Literature, Civil War, American Literature, Moral Education, Patriotism, Nineteenth Century."

The research claims that good literature consistently influences through the sublime, impacts personal narrative, and imitates reality, functioning on both physical and spiritual levels to communicate truth.

    "summary": "This thesis, submitted by Marion Susan Reynolds in 1912, explores the concept of \"expression\" within music and literature. It defines expression, examines art as a medium for ideas, and distinguishes between thought and emotion in both disciplines. The study posits music as the primary art form for expressing emotions due to its direct appeal to the human spirit, exemplified by folk songs and musical motives that create melody and harmony. It also analyzes the emotional element in literature, illustrated by lyric poetry and Greek literary forms, and the thought element in music, as seen in pastoral symphonies. The work concludes that the mission of art is to \"sweeten, mellow and strengthen us.\""

    "abstract": "George N. Appell, M.B.A., A.M. (Harvard), Ph.D. (Australian National University) is a social anthropologist. He has done fieldwork, assisted by his wife Laura W.R. Appell, among the Dogrib Indians of the Northwest Territories of Canada, the Rungus of Sabah, Malaysia, and the Bulusu’ of Indonesian Borneo. They began working with the Rungus in 1959 to record their social organization, language, religion and cultural ecology. They continue to work with the Rungus and are compiling ‘The Rungus Cultural Dictionary’ as well as managing the Sabah Oral Literature Project. This project continues to collect the oral literature of the Rungus and other peoples of the Kudat Peninsula. Dr Appell is cofounder and president of the Borneo Research Council, founder and president of the Firebird Foundation for Anthropological Research, founder of the Anthropologists’ Fund for Urgent Anthropological Research, and is Senior Visiting Scholar in the Department of Anthropology, Brandeis University. He is currently finishing a monograph on culture-free methods to determine rights over resource tenure and other property interests that are faithful to the local distinctions. Other information on the publications of the Appells can be found at: www.gnappell.orgGeorge and Laura Appell were prevented by the Sabah government from continuing their research among the Rungus, which had begun in 1959-1963. But in 1986 they were permitted to return to the Rungus and visit their friends. By then little of the traditional Rungus social organization and culture remained unchanged, except for their oral literature. Consequently, George and Laura Appell formed the Sabah Oral Literature Project to collect the various genre from the Rungus and related ethnic groups. The project was so constructed as to be run by the Rungus for the Rungus, with the Appells providing equipment, direction and training. It was hoped that this project would form a model for ethnic groups in other areas of Sabah and in other regions of the world to begin collecting their own oral literature. This article covers the various genre of Rungus oral literature from the extensive religious poems performed by priestesses to cure illness and promote fertility, to the prayers for the rice spirits, to historical narratives, songs, and word play. It discusses the selection of personnel to collect texts, their training, the equipment used, the payment of performers, the transcription of texts, the archiving of the recordings and problems in translating the texts. Translation and exegesis requires a detailed knowledge of the culture, which may necessitate study and analysis by scholars outside the society.World Oral Literature Project and the Firebird Foundation for Anthropological Research",

    "abstract": "This article presents the outcomes of research, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council in England and informed by work in the fields of new literacy research, gaming studies and the socio-cultural framing of education, for which the videogame L.A. Noire (Rockstar Games, 2011) was studied within the orthodox framing of the English Literature curriculum at A Level (pre-University) and Undergraduate (degree level). There is a plethora of published research into the kinds of literacy practices evident in videogame play, virtual world engagement and related forms of digital reading and writing (Gee, 2003; Juul, 2005; Merchant, Gillen, Marsh and Davies, 2012; Apperley and Walsh, 2012; Bazalgette and Buckingham, 2012) as well as the implications of such for home / school learning (Dowdall, 2006; Jenkins, 2006; Potter, 2012) and for teachers’ own digital lives (Graham, 2012). Such studies have tended to focus on younger children and this research is also distinct from such work in the field in its exploration of the potential for certain kinds of videogame to be understood as 'digital transformations' of conventional ‘schooled’ literature. The outcomes of this project raise implications of such a conception for a further implementation of a ‘reframed’ literacy (Marsh, 2007) within the contemporary curriculum of a traditional and conservative ‘subject’. A mixed methods approach was adopted. Firstly, students contributing to a gamplay blog requiring them to discuss their in-game experience through the ‘language game’ of English Literature, culminating in answering a question constructed with the idioms of the subject’s set text ‘final examination’. Secondly, students taught their teachers to play L.A. Noire, with free choice over the context for this collaboration. Thirdly, participants returned to traditional roles in order to work through a set of study materials provided, designed to reproduce the conventions of the ‘study guide’ for literature education. Interviews were conducted after each phase and the outcomes informed a redrafting of the study materials which are now available online for teachers – this being the ‘practical’ outcome of the research (Berger and McDougall, 2012). In the act of inserting the study of L.A. Noire into the English Literature curriculum as currently framed, this research moves, through a practical ‘implementation’ beyond longstanding debates around narratology and ludology (Frasca, 2003; Juul, 2005) in the field of game studies (Leaning, 2012) through a direct connection to new literacy studies and raises epistemological questions about ‘subject identity’, informed by Bernstein (1996) and Bourdieu (1986) and the implications for digital transformations of texts for both ideas about cultural value in schooled literacy (Kendall and McDougall, 2011) and the politics of ‘expertise’ in pedagogic relations (Ranciere, 2009, Bennett, Kendall and McDougall, 2012a)",

For centuries, knowledge was limited to unreliable ancient accounts; only with archaeological work and scholarly attention to original sources did Egypt's significance become clear. The Egyptians, though exclusive, influenced Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Greeks. While lacking artistic literary style and rhetorical development compared to the Greeks, Egyptian literature offers a fascinating study of a prolonged, isolated literary evolution in its primitive form, with its simplicity sometimes forming its main appeal.

    "summary": "This review addresses eosinophilic otitis media, a recently recognized condition characterized by sudden hearing loss, often associated with bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. The diagnostic criteria are vague, but the presence of eosinophils in middle ear secretions is considered pathognomonic. The condition involves excessive eosinophil accumulation and persistent middle ear effusion, with pathophysiology linked to allergic reactions. The paper discusses its historical recognition, clinical manifestations, and potential treatments including steroids, antihistamines, and grommet insertion for acute hearing loss, highlighting the importance of eosinophil detection for diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Many policies and projects now encourage investigators to share their raw research data with other scientists. Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these initiatives because data can be shared in such a variety of mechanisms and locations. We propose a novel approach to finding shared datasets: using NLP techniques to identify declarations of dataset sharing within the full text of primary research articles. Using regular expression patterns and machine learning algorithms on open access biomedical literature, our system was able to identify 61% of articles with shared datasets with 80% precision. A simpler version of our classifier achieved higher recall (86%), though lower precision (49%). We believe our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and hope to inspire further study of dataset retrieval techniques and policy evaluation.&#xd;&#xa",

    "abstract": "One consequence of international law’s recent historical turn has been to sharpen methodological contrasts between intellectual history and international law.  Scholars including Antony Anghie, Anne Orford, Rose Parfitt, and Martti Koskenniemi have taken on board historians’ interest in contingency and context but pointedly relaxed historians’ traditional stricture against presentist instrumentalism.  This essay argues that such a move disrupts a longstanding division of labor between history and international law and ultimately brings international legal method closer to literature and literary scholarship.  The essay therefore details several more or less endemic ways in which literature and literary studies confront challenges of presentism, anachronism, meaning, and time.  Using examples from writers as diverse as Anghie, Spinoza, Geoffrey Hill, Emily St. John Mandel, China Miéville, John Hollander, Pascale Casanova, Matthew Nicholson, John Selden, Shakespeare, and Dante, it proposes a “trilateral” discussion among historians, international lawyers, and literary scholars that takes seriously the multipolar disciplinary field in which each of these disciplines makes and sustains relations with each of the others.       \n",

    "abstract": "Motivation: The use of prior knowledge to improve gene regulatory network modelling has often been proposed. In this paper we present the first research on the massive incorporation of prior knowledge from literature for Bayesian network learning of gene networks. As the publication rate of scientific papers grows, updating online databases, which have been proposed as potential prior knowledge in past rese-arch, becomes increasingly challenging. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of gene-pair association scores that describe the over-lap in the contexts in which the genes are mentioned, generated from a large database of scientific literature, harnessing the information contained in a huge number of documents into a simple, clear format. Results: We present a method to transform such literature-based gene association scores to network prior probabilities, and apply it to learn gene sub-networks for yeast, E. coli and Human organisms. We also investigate the effect of weighting the influence of the prior know-ledge. Our findings show that literature-based priors can improve both the number of true regulatory interactions present in the network and the accuracy of expression value prediction on genes, in comparison to a network learnt solely from expression data. Networks learnt with priors also show an improved biological interpretation, with identified subnetworks that coincide with known biological pathways. Contact",

The study examines the British idea of 'Empire' and the\n\ncolonial enterprise in a selected range of 20th-century texts, in an attempt to understand how imperialism affected literary texts produced in some former colonies particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America. Texts to be considered in this study include: Marquez’s No One Writes to the Colonel, Enroll John’s\n\nMoon on a Rainbow Shawl and Marechera’s House of Hunger. The\n\nstudy will be viewing a literature characterized by elements of the fantastic woven into the story.

    "abstract": "In his paper, \"The Canonization of German-language Digital Literature,\" Florian Hartling discusses \"Net Literature,\" a relatively young phenomenon, that has its roots in experimental visual and concrete poetry and hypertext. With the use of new media technology, this new genre of literature has acquired much interest and is now considered to be one of the most important influences in contemporary art. Not only does Net Literature connect sound, video, and animation with interactivity and allows new forms of artistic expression, it also impacts significantly on the traditional functions of the literary system. Hartling suggests that, in relation to Net Literature, the notion of the \"death of the author\" gives birth to the \"writing reader.\" Hartling presents the results of his study where he applies the concept of \"canon\" to German-language Net Literature and where he attempts to find out whether, in this new form of literature, a \"canon\" has already been formed. Based on Karl Erik Rosengren's framework of \"mention technique,\" a sample of Germanlanguage reviews of Net Literature was analyzed. The study intends to test the applicability of Rosengren's method to the analysis of Net Literature, that is, whether it is valid to use a method that was originally developed for the empirical study of the traditional literary canon for the study of an emergent Net Literature",

    "title": "Anthologizing Sir Samuel Ferguson: Literature, History, Politics",
    "abstract": "Published Online: 2013-10-25; This content is open access.Although Sir Samuel Ferguson is generally recognized as one of the key figures of mid-nineteenth-century Irish literature, there has been no major edition of his poems since 1916, as a result of which his work tends to be known to the general reader through selections published in anthologies. The essay analyzes the selections of Ferguson’s work in anthologies of Irish literature published between 1895 and 2010 in an attempt to assess the impact of the cultural dynamics of twentieth-century Ireland on the interpretation of Ferguson’s achievement as a poet. The evidence collected demonstrates that the image of Ferguson perpetuated by most twentiethcentury anthologists, most of them Hibernocentric in approach, was that of a respectable if rather old-fashioned Romantic nationalist antiquarian, whose work focused primarily on familiarizing the Victorian reader with the ancient myths and traditions of Ireland. This interpretation of Ferguson’s achievement, motivated, it is argued, by the predominantly nationalist agenda of modern Ireland’s cultural establishment, has largely marginalized the other side of Ferguson—a political thinker committed to the unionist cause and vehemently opposed to the violence perpetrated by the emergent Irish republican movement and culminating in the Phoenix Park murders of 1882, which formed the subject of two of Ferguson’s most powerful late poems, “At the Polo-Ground” and “In Carey’s Footsteps.",

    "title": "Integrated assessment : new assessment methods literature review",
    "abstract": "The assessment of students in higher education performs a number of functions, some of which may not always be compatible with each other. Traditionally, the role of the assessor has involved determining the level of competence displayed in undertaking the task, and ideally, offering feedback on future learning needs (Rowntree, 1987). Assessment also provides grading for students’ work, allowing comparison of performance across a class, and across the curriculum for individual students. The subsequent gaining of a degree or professional qualification depends on students successfully completing a set of specified assessment tasks across the prescribed curriculum. As such, there may be stakeholders beyond the higher education institution, such as employers, regulatory bodies or clients, who believe the assessment process as being akin to certification or professional gatekeeping (Younes,1998). In professional courses such as social work, passing certain assessment tasks may be associated with notions such as fitness to practice and eligibility for professional registration as a social worker with the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) or similar bodies in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and beyond the United Kingdom. In terms of gatekeeping, assessment tasks may not only restrict who gains certification on exiting an educational programme, but also who is admitted in the first place. For example, requirements by registration authorities that students admitted to social work programmes have achieved specified levels of literacy and numeracy will require appropriate assessment tasks to determine equivalence for those entrants who have not achieved formal qualifications in these areas. Entry point assessments may also be used to determine whether credit should be granted on the basis of prior learning or experience (Slater, 2000) or to identify areas in which additional training may be required (Shera, 2001) In addition to gatekeeping, assessment clearly has a vital role to play in the ongoing development of learning and teaching strategies. It can be crucial in determining what, why and how students learn (Brown, Bull and Pendlebury, 1997) and there is increasing recognition of the necessity to align learning and assessment tasks, so that learning and assessment become aligned rather than being somewhat independent of each other (Biggs, 2003). Furthermore, in an era when evaluation of teaching is often reduced to student satisfaction surveys, critical reflection on work submitted for assessment can serve as an alternative method of evaluating the success of teaching. The nature of assessment has changed considerably since the 1970s, and is ongoing. The key changes have included moves from written examinations to coursework assignments and more emphasis on student participation in assessment (self and peer assessments), processes rather than products, and on competencies rather than content (Brown et al., 1997). Even the more traditional forms of assessment such as essays and examinations have undergone considerable innovations. Yet, in practice these seemingly radical changes may be more a wish list than a statement of fact. In actuality, some new forms of assessment, such as self and peer assessment may simply have been added onto rather than replaced more traditional modes of assessment (Cree, 2000). Changes to assessment in social work tend to reflect changes in higher education more widely such as the emergence of competency based and modular approaches to learning, as well more proceduralised assessment processes necessary to cope with higher numbers of students (Cree, 2000). There is considerable divergence of opinion amongst the social work education community in the United Kingdom as to whether such changes actually benefit social work students and their learning (eg Clark, 1997; Ford and Hayes, 1996; O’Hagan, 1997; Shardlow and Doel, 1996). There have also been concerns expressed as to whether some new forms of assessment are actually capable of achieving the learning they claim to facilitate Boud, 1999; Entwistle, 1990; Taylor, 1993). This report was commissioned by the Scottish Institute for Excellence in Social Work Education (SIESWE) as a resource on assessment for the development of the new social work degree in Scotland and provides an overview of the current literature on assessment methods being utilised in social work education both in the United Kingdom and beyond. This report begins by reviewing the various methods of assessment in social work education which were found in the literature. We then go on to explore the developing literature on the involvement of persons other than social work academics, such as students and service users, in the assessment process. Finally, we consider the importance of developing and assessment strategy which might incorporate these various different forms of assessmen",

    "abstract": "Silence is a major value in Native American culture, for silence is the token of acceptance, the symbol of peace and serenity, and the outward expression of harmony between the human and natural worlds. The result of this tradition of silence, however, is a limited written record, a limited number of texts produced by Native Americans themselves. This situation allowed the Anglo to step into the void and speak for Native Americans themselves, or more accurately, to claim to speak as their  interpreters.  The implication that white culture drew from the lack of a written language in any of the Native American tribes was that these people had nothing of value to say to themselves or to others. It was not until the past twenty years that Native Americans have begun to produce their own literary works written in English with an eye toward communicating with the American population as a whole. Until the publication of Scott Momaday\\u27s House Made of Dawn (1968), the general population had not heard actual Native Americans speak in their own voices-the white culture had been speaking for them. During the past twenty years, however, there has been a veritable explosion of texts coming from the Native American community, and we now have a substantial corpus to use in teaching contemporary Native American literature",

    "title": "The Chronotopic Imagination in Literature and Film",
    "abstract": "In this contribution, I would like to examine the way in which Bakhtin, in the two essays dedicated to the chronotope, lays the foundations for a theory of literary imagination. […] His concept of the chronotope may be interpreted as a contribution to a tradition in which Henri Bergson, William James, Charles Sander Peirce and Gilles Deleuze have been key figures. Like these four authors, Bakhtin is a philosopher in the school of pragmatism. His predilection for what Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson have called “prosaics” puts him right at the heart of a philosophical family that calls forth multiplicity against metaphysical essentialism, and prefers the mundane to the universal. It seems wise to proceed carefully in the attempt to reconstruct Bakhtin’s theory of imagination. In this contribution to the debate, I choose to develop a philosophical dialogue between Bakhtin and the above-mentioned philosophical family. More specifically, it seems to me that the ideal point of departure for examining the way in which Bakhtin attempts to get to the bottom of the mysteries of literary imagination is Gilles Deleuze’s synthesis of Bergson’s epistemological view on knowledge as “the perception of images”, as well as Peirce’s theory of experience based on a typology of images. In the following, I show that Bakhtin’s view of the temporal-spatial constellations in literature demonstrates a strong affinity to the Bergsonian view that perception of the spatial world is colored by the lived time experienced by the observer. Based on this observation, I then develop a typology of images which places the concept of the chronotope in a more systematic framework",

The paper demonstrates affinities between Bakhtin's and Bergson's views on temporal-spatial constellations in literature, leading to the development of a typology of images that systematically frames the chronotope concept."

Veiga.Students’ Engagement in School has been the focus of debate concerning academic success and school dropout, and pointed out as a mean to address the problems affecting our schools and their students, not only for having value in itself, but also for being an important mediator between several\r\nacademic variables. This paper reviews the research and literature on this concept and its relations with personal and contextual variables, as well as with academic performance, with the aim of\r\nsummarizing the main relationships found. Literature presents a significant number of studies which sustain that personal variables, such as self-efficacy and self-concept, as well as contextual - peers,\r\nschool, family- are related with school engagement. The adoption of mastery goals, for instance, has a positive impact on school, as they are related with the use of cognitive and self-regulatory strategies\r\nby students. Positive relationships with peers, teachers support and the quality of family relations are associated with higher levels of engagement and academic performance, while negative experiences,\r\nsuch as bullying, are related with educational difficulties. Following this, we reflect about the relevance\r\nof studying engagement in school, in the context of widespread financial crisis, and emphasize the need to rethink educational institutions considering the paradigmatic changes that currently occur.This work is financed by National Founds through FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, in the\r\ncontext of the project PTDC/CPE-CED/114362/2009- Students Engagement in Schools: Differentiation and Promotion, coordinated by Prof. Feliciano H.

I While many efforts have been made to explore these aspects of multiculturalism, its significance in poetry, particularly in poetry\\u27s composition and critique, has not been duly taken into account. Multicultural poetry designates a critical abstraction in which poetry is classified by relation to a communal culture, history, or customs. In this definition, multicultural poetry is therefore inclusive of poetry written by ethnic minorities, women, non-mainstream religious practitioners, and members of other communities. To maintain a focus, this article delimits its discussion to poetry\\u27s relationship with ethnicity and probes the interplay between aesthetic and ethnicity in three sections–Mainstream Poetry Anthologies: Tastes, Schools, and the Issue of History, Multicultural Poetry Anthologies: Situated Poetry and Group Poetics, and Ethnopoetics as a Choice",

It addresses three core questions: the meaning of Aristotle's statement, the constraints it imposes on constructing tragic plots (specifically regarding the role of chance), and the underlying reasons why poetry necessitates these universal constraints. The analysis delves into philosophical implications, particularly in relation to tragedy and other poetic genres like epic and comedy, arguing for the intrinsic superiority of universalizing genres."

    "abstract": "The argument put forward here takes Antonio Skármeta's short novel El cartero de Neruda (Con ardiente paciencia) as a theorization of the relationship between poetry and politics, by way of the concept-metaphors (Mieke Bal) that are deployed in the novel. Skármeta stages the public role of poetry through the telling of a story about the poet Pablo Neruda and his postman Mario Jiménez. The relationship between poetry and politics is analysed with reference to Hazard Adams' concept of «the offense of poetry» and Roland Barthes' reflections on the total scandal of language in his essay «Écrivains et écrivants» (1964), here adapted as «the total scandal of poetry». In contradistinction to Barthes, who argues that the total scandal of language is impossible because of the absorption of scandalous language by the literary institution, Skármeta's short novel suggests that the total scandal of poetry is indeed possible when, as in the case of Pablo Neruda, Mario Jiménez and Salvador Allende, poetry becomes a constitutive part of a political project, within which it functions as a reminder of dignity and as the touchstone for political integrity",

    "abstract": "This article opens a dialogue between geohumanities and poetry—or, more broadly, creative writing—around the subject matters of violence and wounding. It considers what kinds of “poetry” might be usefully enrolled by the geoliterary critic, or even authored by the geographer-poet, in response to such subject matters. Difficult questions abound about what it means to author, hear, and read poetry that is engaged and enraged by instances of violence, trauma, and victimhood. One horizon for these questions is Adorno’s ([1966] 1973) claim that “there can be no more poetry after Auschwitz,” and more particularly his elaboration and partial retreat from this claim in Negative Dialectics. Here, wary of attempts “at squeezing any kind of sense, however bleached, out of the victims’ fate” (Adorno [1966] 1973, 361), he nonetheless concluded that “perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man to scream; hence it may be wrong to say that after Auschwitz you can no longer write poems” (363). This article explores Adorno’s position, chiefly pursuing his arguments about the need for poetry—and indeed philosophy—that strives not for “purity” but precisely to be “soiled” and “spoiled,” never comforting, always disconcerting, never idealistically “transcendent,” always materialistically “micrological.” Including reference to a short story by Borges and critique of poetry by the geographer Wreford Watson, the argument is further advanced by attending to Adorno’s claims about another poet, Heine, sometimes regarded as a particularly “geographical” poet. The article concludes with final notes on possible implications for recasting work on wounded geographies as a species of applied micrology",

Comic poetry finds the truth in the illogical and in the absurd; it finds what unsettles us through its use of surprise; it finds delight and play in the unknown and uncertain. By its very nature, comic poetry clings to the edges of what we know, so pinpointing its characteristics is tricky. But the shared characteristic of all comic poetry is the permission the poet grants herself to disobey boundaries. The poet chooses not to fit her works within the reader’s expectations, the reader’s sense of logic, or the reader’s definitions of things in the world. Some of the boundaries crossed come out of breaking out of poetic custom. Many poems break boundaries of thought and expression; a comic poet uses one or more of these techniques to bring her funny poems to profound places. The result is always the exploration of unexplored or underexplored territory",

The speaker describes them as people who shed warm clothing, expose themselves to the sun with SPF, and prefer iced coffee and stevia. They are depicted congregating at pools, laughing at parties, and enjoying grilled meat and cocktails, seemingly oblivious to the impending arrival of September. The poem uses vivid imagery and a somewhat sardonic tone to portray these 'summer people' and their seasonal habits."

    "abstract": "The Chinese translation of English metrical poetry has a history of more than one\n\nhundred years, but it is still controversial on how to translate English metrical poetry into\n\nChinese. Chinese translators have hitherto devised three methods to render English\n\nmetrical poetry: sinolization, liberalization, and poetic form transplantation. Translators\n\npracticing the methods of sinolization and liberalization belong to the group in favor of\n\nspiritual resemblance. Translators who follow the method of poetic form transplantation\n\nbelong to the group in favor of formal resemblance. It is quite obvious that the two\n\ngroups have disagreement on the translation standard or guiding principle. Actually the\n\ntranslation standards of the two groups can coexist, and the translation methods under the\n\nguidance of these different translation standards can coexist and complement each other.\n\nIt is impractical and impossible to use one Chinese translation method or standard to\n\nguide all the Chinese translation practice, and the diverse Chinese translation methods of\n\nEnglish metrical poetry can coexist and complement each other in the foreseeable future",

Translators are categorized into groups prioritizing spiritual resemblance (sinolization, liberalization) or formal resemblance (poetic form transplantation). The study argues that these diverse translation standards and methods are not mutually exclusive but can coexist and complement each other, suggesting that it is impractical to enforce a single translation approach. Key concepts include translation standards, guiding principles, spiritual resemblance, and formal resemblance in poetry translation."

    "abstract": "This draft paper focuses on Newfoundland poet Mary Dalton's 2013 book Hooking -- a collection of centos (poems composed only of lines from other poems) -- in order to propose a method for reading the exercise of users' rights in Canadian poetry by attending to poetry books' paratexts (front and end matter that acknowledges permissions or cites sources). This talk moves from an introductory discussion of users' rights enshrined in Canadian copyright law (e.g. fair dealing, the public domain) to a survey of poetry books, including Dalton's, and how their paratexts frame these books' transformative use of other works. The talk aims to promote a more widespread and robust exercise of users' rights in the service of cultural production and expressive freedom by showing the extent to which published authors, no less than users or readers, need fair dealing too.\r\n(Posted for open review, this is a preliminary draft of a talk to be given at a workshop on cento poetry, held at the University of Bochum, Germany, in November 2020.",

It aims to encourage a broader exercise of users' rights for cultural production and expressive freedom, arguing that published authors also benefit from fair dealing. The research highlights Dalton's cento procedure, where each line is from a different poem, relating it to traditional Newfoundland rug-hooking as a metaphor for combining diverse materials.

    "title": "The impact of the Netherlandish landscape tradition on poetry and painting in early modern England",
    "abstract": "Copyright © 2013 The University of Chicago Press.The relationship between poetry and painting has been one of the most debated issues in the history of criticism. The present article explores this problematic relationship in the context of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, taking into account theories of rhetoric, visual perception, and art. It analyzes a rare case in which a specific school of painting directly inspired poetry: in particular, the ways in which the Netherlandish landscape tradition influenced natural descriptions in the poem Poly-Olbion (1612, 1622) by Michael Drayton (1563–1631). Drayton — under the influence of the artistic principles of landscape depiction as explained in Henry Peacham’s art manuals, as well as of direct observation of Dutch and Flemish landscape prints and paintings — successfully managed to render pictorial landscapes into poetry. Through practical examples, this essay will thoroughly demonstrate that rhetoric is capable of emulating pictorial styles in a way that presupposes specialized art-historical knowledge, and that pictorialism can be the complex product as much of poetry and rhetoric as of painting and art-theoretical vocabulary",

    "abstract": "This study is concerned with how language is poetically used in one of Nazareth’s song lyrics,\n\n“Love Hurts”. The language encompasses a series of figures of speech. This study was\n\nperformed as an alternative practice in teaching English poetry. Figures of speech intrinsically\n\ncompose English poetry. Because the figures of speech contain implied meaning, they might not\n\nbe easily meaningful to a reader of the lyric. This study is intended to describe the figures of\n\nspeech so that the language becomes more understandable to the reader. This study applies a\n\ntextual analysis, and it adopts Leech’s linguistic guide to English poetry. The linguistic guide\n\nincludes absurdity in the language of poetry; transference of meaning; and over and counter\n\nstatement. The discussion works on each of the lyric’s lines, and it results in the series of figures\n\nof speech, comprising oxymoron, paradox, synecdoche, metaphor, metonymy, hyperbole, litotes,\n\nand irony. The figures of speech indicate that the language is arranged to sweetly sound a\n\nmelody. Besides that, the figures of speech indicate that the language is also used figuratively to\n\ncontain the meaning. In other words, in the lyric, the language was used not only to be sung\n\nmelodically, but it was also used to be written poetically",

After Jonathan's departure and apparent death, she finds herself in a house arranged by Thomas, which outwardly resembles her dream but lacks the intended secret panel.

A recently published collection of poetry by Diana Der Hovanessian suggests how issues raised by those long-ago events permeate the imagination of contempory [contemporary] Armenian American writers, giving poignant focus to their work. Diana Der Hovanessian, the foremost translator of Armenian poetry into English, demonstrated this most memorably in her Anthology of Armenian Poetry. Her first volume, How to Choose Your Past (1978, Ararat Press) displayed her wit and concern with the transmission of the Armenian language in a land where it is vulnerable to extinction. The second volume of her own work, About Time includes many poems which again showcase her strengths: short, epigrammatic pieces which tease the imagination and ironic poems that echo long after the first reading. Though many of these poems deal with non-Armenian subjects, those that weave together the volume once more express the poet\\u27s love for the Armenian language and poets killed at the beginnings of the massacres",

Her collections, including \"How to Choose Your Past\" and \"About Time,\" poignantly address issues like the transmission of the Armenian language and the legacy of martyred poets. Der Hovanessian, a prominent translator, uses short, epigrammatic, and ironic pieces to express her love for Armenian culture and language, even when dealing with non-Armenian subjects.

The avant-garde artists for whom in the beginning of the 20th-century art was an elite occupation, treated every-day speech as a mass form of communication. Tuwim’s poetry was frequently criticised for banality. Matywiecki presents the poet as a hero fighting with the demon of commonness. The crucial thesis of the article is that banality which is modified in a creative way says more about the epoch than elitist visions. In his poetry, satire and cabaret work Tuwim transformed triviality into dialog and a common human being into a creative person. Transition of the street talk into original speech is the defence against reducing individual being to cliché which means the fear of 20th-century killing ideologies.Zadanie „Stworzenie anglojęzycznych wersji wydawanych publikacji”  finansowane w ramach umowy nr 948/P-DUN/2016 ze środków Ministra Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego przeznaczonych na działalność upowszechniającą naukę",

    "abstract": "textElizabeth Robinson's Three Novels (2011) is a lyric re-exploration of three Victorian novels: Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone (1868) and The Woman in White (1859-60), and George Gissing's Eve's Ransom (1895). Robinson ostensibly wrote the poems as an elegy for her father; however, Three Novels also unearths elegiac aspects of its source novels that have been previously unexamined by critics. Each of the Victorian source novels narrates a movement from an initial loss toward an eventual resolution, mirroring the traditional structure of an elegy: mourning is ultimately completed by the acceptance of a compensatory substitute for the loss. While the poetry in Three Novels emphasizes the presence of elegy in its sources, the poems themselves fracture the practice of normative mourning by rewriting these novels in the style of Jahan Ramazani's melancholic \"anti-elegy\" which forecloses the possibility of loss resolution. Because the loss is not neatly resolved, it becomes an object of focus. Reading the anti-elegy manifest in Three Novels creates a space to mourn the losses incurred by each novel, thereby recuperating the overlooked figures of the female, the landscape, and the self that had been diminished by the narrative's drive to resolution.Englis",

The two books, that describe the spiritual struggle of the Catholic priest Saman (1998–2002), call for a religion that is more active in the political arena, but leaves sexual rules to the individual people. The novel Bilangan Fu (2008) condemns the monopoly of the great religions in favour of local and individual spirituality. This is developed in a series of novels of which two more have already appeared. A third cycle of three more or less autobiographic novels (2003–2013) sketch her personal quest from atheism towards a critical but positive spirituality condemning a clerical and monopolist trend in Catholicism. Utami's criticism of the great religions is external (more players in the field should be recognised) and internal (religious leaders should have more modest claims towards their faithful and leave more space for personal choice)",

    "abstract": "In The Correspondence of Samuel Richardson (1804), Anna Letitia Barbauld set out to assure readers that the novelist’s personal character (as displayed in his letters) corresponded to his authorial moral character (as inferred through his novels) in order to present him as an appropriate father of the modern British novel – a process I call the “canonisation of private character.” To that end, Barbauld’s editorial work presented Richardson as a benevolent patriarchal figure whose moral authority over the domestic life of his extended family guaranteed the morality of his novels and of his personal character. As my case study of Richardson’s correspondence with Sarah Wescomb shows, Barbauld’s interventions accordingly muted challenges to Richardson’s authority on questions of paternal control or filial obedience. Life writing, textual criticism, and literary history were therefore so intimately intertwined in Barbauld’s treatment of Richardson and his writings that they mutually constituted and sustained each other. Her contributions to the elevation and institution of novels as a national literary genre – in the Correspondence as well as in her later prefaces to The British Novelists (1810) – accordingly should be read in conjunction with her biographical elevation and canonisation of Richardson as the first properly moral, modern novelist",

Many materialist scholars fault post-Romantic critics for casting Shakespeare as a psychological realist and reading his plays as if they were novels. The burlesque treatment of Hamlet’s soliloquies, however, suggests a contrary trajectory, challenging the equation of Shakespearean character with psychological reflection. Rather than inaugurating a tradition of interiority, Hamlet’s soliloquies generate social speech in works like Gilbert’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, inviting audience participation.

For twenty-first-century readers, novels such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge's Modem Chivalry, Susanna Rowson's Charlotte Temple or Charles Brockden Brown's Wieland seem firmly embedded in a premodern culture that subordinates the rights of art under those of religion, morality, and education. In their persistent didacticism, their claims to truthfulness and social utility, and their long authorial digressions, these texts perform those kinds of heteronomous functions Romantic theorizing and literary practice of the early nineteenth century would seek to reject in their quest for literary autonomy. Yet a closer look at early American novels also reveals elements of modern artistic practice that exist side by side with premodern residues. Brackenridge, for instance, repeatedly insists that his work is but an exercise in style devoid of ideas, praises originality and the figure of the genius, consistently privileges form over subject matter, and ridicules the excessive didacticism of his contemporaries. In such passages, we can see a modern consciousness at work. Tensions between these modern impulses and a premodern sensibility pervade both early novels and aesthetics, another invention of the eighteenth century. This paper discusses those tensions from a systems-theoretical perspective",

    "abstract": "Best known for his tetralogy Antagonía, Luis Goytisolo began his literary career under the Franco dictatorship and soon developed a reputation as an intellectual\\u27s writer. His intricate and sinewy prose challenged readers to follow his narrators down labyrinthine paths of extended metaphors, embedded clauses and erudite references. Interestingly enough, the novels of Goytisolo published in the last decade lack the narrative complexity and structural experimentalism characteristic of his earlier works. These 90s novels include: Estatua con palomas (1992), Mzungo (1996), Placer licuante (1997), and Escalera hacia el cielo (1999). Some might feel that his change to a more traditional narrative style indicates a compromise of his intellectual project and wonder if he has succumbed to the pressures created by the commercialization of Spanish fiction",

    "abstract": "In 1930, Hungarian- born Jewish author Arthur Holitscher’s book Wiedersehn mit Amerika: Die Verwandlung der U.S.A. (Reunion with America: The Trans-formation of the U.S.A.) was reviewed by one J. Raphael in the German- Jewish Orthodox weekly newspaper, Der Israelit. This reviewer concluded: “Despite its good reputation, America is a strange country. And Holitscher, whose relationship to Judaism is not explicit, but direct, has determined that to be the case for American Jews as well.” The reviewer’s use of the word “strange” (komisch) offers powerful insight into the complex perceptions of America held by many German- speaking Jews, which in 1930 were at best mixed and ambivalent. An earlier travel book by Arthur Holitscher (1869– 1941) from 1912 depicts America more favorably, though it is widely believed to have provided inspiration for Franz Kafka’s unfinished novel, Amerika: Der Verschollene (Amerika or The Man who Disappeared, published posthumously in 1927), which famously opens with a description of the Statue of Liberty holding aloft a sword rather than a torch.

I approach this question largely through the developing critical field of everyday life studies, in particular on literature and the everyday. There is a surprising paucity of literary criticism focused specifically on the narrative of the single day, and in this essay I launch further discussions of the form, particularly insofar as instances of the one-day novel can also (paradoxically) be read as novels of the everyday. In particular, I argue the one-day novel offers a model for a narrative that operates at a graspably human scale, having a particular capacity to reveal, attend to, and explore the apparently nonproductive or passive elements of everyday life; and that the form also interrogates on the capacity (or otherwise) for individuals to assert agency therein. Finally, I explore the paradoxical future orientation of the apparently bounded and closed single-day narrative structure",

It establishes a fractal power law for lexical wealth (ratio of unique words to total words). By utilizing the exponent and amplitude of this power law, alongside the standard deviation of lexical wealth as an author's signature, the study successfully discriminates between different genres and writers, even distinguishing between short stories and novels by the same author. This method provides a distinct statistical signature for individual authors."

The fact that Arriaga has crossed the lines between writing, adapting, and directing his own works in Spanish and English leads me to review the current relations of film and literature in general. Finally, by comparing Arriaga’s novels and films, I propose that the contemporary practice of film adaptation contributes to the “flexibilization” in the roles writers, actors, and directors play in filmmaking and in the circulation of cultural capital between film and literature in the current media markets",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of her first novel, A Piece of the Night, in 1978, Michele Roberts’ fiction has continually returned to epiphanic moments which elide divisions in time and space. Roberts uses her own experience as a woman of two cultures (English and French), as well as fictionalised histories of other women, to inform narratives in which the borders of history, culture and identity are figured as complex palimpsests. From the quasi-autobiographical narratives in A Piece of the Night and The Visitation (1983), Roberts moved on to rewrite biblical biographies of Mrs Noah (The Book of Mrs Noah, 1987) and Mary Magdalene (The Wild Girl, 1984). In In the Red Kitchen (1990) five female narrators ‘speak’ to each other, creating a textual dialogue in which conclusions are not fixed and time never stands still. Flesh and Blood (1994) offers a series of dovetailed narratives and withholds any sense of closure. With reference to feminist work on time and space, this essay examines the extent to which Roberts’ fiction engages with contemporary debates about the fragmentation and reconstruction of feminine identity. White argues that siting such discussion within narrative fiction offers a logical and accessible location for theorizing the (im)possible",

    "abstract": "Rival views of Scotland at the beginning of the twenty-first century see the nation as either, hopelessly schizophrenic, mired in its own bedevilled tartanry and forever salvaging the present through historic erasure or as a cosmopolitan postnation at ease with its contradictory legacies and able to tap its inherent multiplicities for a contemporary self image. These contentions are being interrogated in public debates and  political contexts as well as in literature in Scotland. The process of re-imagining or re-visioning Scotland began much earlier than 1999 when the Scottish Parliament, last adjourned in 1707, was reconvened. Contemporary authors have long been reconsidering issues of identity and how this could and should be represented in their writing.\n\n\n\nThis paper will examine how the underlying forces of insistent Scottish identity-making now seem to be moving in the direction of synthesis rather than fragmentation within literature, permitting multiple perspectives and a plurality of approaches through different genres, recognising other people’s rights to perceive or imagine Scotland differently. Anne Forbes’ novels Dragonfire,(2006) The Wings of Ruksh (2007) and The Underground City (2008), fully post-modern fantasy novels, will be used as examples of  ‘fusion’ texts introducing an optimistic new notion of ‘belonging’ transcending the cultural fatalism of the so-called ‘clash of civilisations’ hypothesis and building positively on the politics of difference. They represent a form of literary cosmopolitanism entirely consonant with the way Scottish society currently aspires to progress, offering the right set of circumstances for developing new forms of syncretistic myth-making and storytelling across and between communities",

    "summary": "This paper examines contemporary Scottish identity in literature, moving towards synthesis rather than fragmentation. It challenges rival views of Scotland as either \"schizophrenic\" or a \"cosmopolitan postnation.\" Using Anne Forbes' postmodern fantasy novels—Dragonfire (2006), The Wings of Ruksh (2007), and The Underground City (2008)—as examples of \"fusion\" texts, the study introduces an optimistic notion of \"belonging.\" It transcends cultural fatalism, builds on the politics of difference, and represents a literary cosmopolitanism aligned with Scotland's societal aspirations. The research highlights the development of new syncretistic myth-making and storytelling across communities, exploring how identity is accommodated within individual self-fashioning and shared socialization."

Petermann explores the \"musical novel\" subgenre, defined by its formal imitation of musical structures rather than content. The work prompts a re-evaluation of classical problems such as the essence of music, boundaries of art forms, and the relationship between music and language through these unique textual artworks. The review highlights that Petermann emphasizes textual imitation over intersemiotic juxtaposition for achieving musical presence in novels, rigorously clarifying that a \"musical\" novel does not aspire to be music itself."

    "title": "Place, paradox, and transcendental connection in three of E. M. Forster's novels : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in English at Massey University",
    "abstract": "E. M. Forster's fiction reflects his own concern with the spirit of place and his seemingly fruitless search for a spiritual reconciliation between people and places. Three novels, Where Angels Fear to Tread, Howards End and A Passage to India, set out how place functions in Forster's fiction. In these, Forster poses what appears to be an insoluble question for the reader, and proves himself reluctant to achieve closure. This reluctance to provide answers to the theme of place is a reflection of the philosophical uncertainty which pervades his fiction. Readers are encouraged to arrive at their own conclusions and to negotiate the ambivalence of his novels in order to find their own answers to the baffling nature of life and relationships. Place, in Forster's fiction, contains an unseen force that is almost tangible. It determines the movement of the characters and guides them towards their intended destinations. The characters in his novels are transformed and manipulated by the device of genius loci; yet their changes never enable them to achieve permanent attachments with others nor with places. Although Forster's fiction shows no final harmonious home where ancestry and roots are established, the eponymous house in Howards End offers us a window. In it, the sisters achieve an affinity with place; however, there is still no space in which all of humanity can connect, and paradoxically, exclusion is essential to the final scene of reconciliation. Contradiction and opposition inform all of Forster's fiction. In each novel there are localities which represent the socially-controlled space on the one hand, and on the other, the unfettered region. Although Forster shows a Modernist tendency to nostalgically idealise the past, he continues to search for that delicate equilibrium between people and place. But just as he criticises and praises culture, he sees that the rural regions have their own contradictory attributes. This thesis traces Forster's treatment of place through personal, social, cultural, and spiritual sites, and the search for an esoteric home and transcendental reconciliation, becoming as it does an increasingly tentative and paradoxical theme",

    "abstract": "This paper turns around the key concern that it has become almost impossible to imagine a form of the future that is neither a prolongation of what already exists nor its apocalyptic demise. In trying to find ways of reconceiving the future in a more productive fashion, the paper relies heavily on Fredric Jameson?s work. Jameson worries that the traditional realist novel, which has featured so prominently in discussions of ?literature? in the field of organization studies, has committed itself far too readily to what he terms ?ontological realism?: the deliberate confusion of that which is meaningful with that which exists. He therefore explores the potential of Science Fiction (SF), and in particular radical SF from the 1960s and 1970s, for figuring a break with a hollowed-out present. This is achieved, for example, by transforming our own present into the past of something yet to come. It is as if Walter Benjamin?s angel of history would stand in an imaginary future with its face turned back towards our present. Such revelatory time-slips find their clearest expression in the novels of Philip K Dick, and it is to them that this paper will turn when working through some concrete examples",

    "abstract": "When one begins a study of the women in Hardy's novels one discovers critical views of great diversity. There are features of Hardy's work which received favourable comment then as now; his descriptions of nature for instance, and his rustic characters have appealed to most critics over the years. But his philosophical and social comment have drawn criticism ranging from the virulent to the scornful. In particular his attitude to and treatment of love and marriage relationships have been widely argued, and it is the women concerned who have been assessed in the most surprising and contradictory manner. The first critic of stature was Lionel Johnson¹Lionel Johnson, The Art of Thomas Hardy (1894). London, 1923, p.193. best known as a poet. In 1894 he wrote of Hardy's women: 'I cannot think that any of them is so powerfully conceived and drawn as are the best of the men;' but he adds that they provoke an 'amazed awe of their infinite ingenuities,' and quotes a remark of Swift's about the pleasure that a few words 'spoken plain by a parrot will give.'

Sarah Grand's The Heavenly Twins is an important contribution to the genre, and engages with a number of the key issues that concerned feminists at the end of the nineteenth century, including marriage, the education of women, the double standard, male licentiousness, and the wider issue of social purity. These are also key themes in Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall — published nearly fifty years before Grand's seminal New Woman text. In this essay, I consider Anne Brontë's text as a forerunner to the New Woman fiction of the fin de siècle, through a comparative examination of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and The Heavenly Twins",

    "summary": "This essay comparatively examines Anne Brontë’s *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall* and Sarah Grand’s *The Heavenly Twins*, positioning Brontë's work as a precursor to fin de siècle New Woman fiction. It explores how both novels challenge patriarchal and feminist ideologies, focusing on themes such as gender roles, marriage, women's education, the double standard, male licentiousness, and social purity. This analysis highlights continuities in feminist concerns across nearly fifty years of nineteenth-century English literature, emphasizing the genre's engagement with societal assumptions about women's position."

In regards to women's fiction in Australia, this canon is\r\npredominantly composed of writers from two particular eras: authors of the\r\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries (like Henry Handel Richardson, Miles\r\nFranklin, Katharine Susannah Prichard and Christina Stead) and women writers\r\nwho came to prominence during the 1980s (like Helen Garner, Kate Grenville,\r\nElizabeth Jolley, Barbara Hanrahan, Jessica Anderson and Beverley Farmer ...

The author, Diane Hoeveler, integrates formalist, historicist, ideological, and psychoanalytic theoretical frameworks, emphasizing the role of law as a significant historical and ideological element. It explores how gothic literature addresses contested legal concepts, critiques the evolving legal system's biases, and reflects a nostalgia for premodern providential justice. The approach aims to help students understand the dynamic interaction between literature and the law, and how novels contributed to public debates on rights and legal evolution."

    "title": "Levinas’ notion of neighbor as an approach to understand Pío Baroja, otherness and modern Spain.",
    "abstract": "The Cold War era touched Spain only subtly. Because of the geopolitical situation of Europe during the second half of the 20th century, Spain remained almost isolated from macro politics, attempting impossible alliances with Italian and German fascism. For instance, whilst the rest of the world witnesses the beginning of the Cold War in 1947 and the Space Race, Spain’s history is marked by the death of a “matador”, Manuel Laureano Rodriguez “Manolete”, who copes the newspapers’ front pages for days and is followed by popular grief and controversy. Four decades before, Miguel de Unamuno already coins this ancestral voice of the Spaniard consciousness as “casticismo” and “intrahistoria”. However, in literary terms, Iberian literature showed clear signs of modernity, and sometimes, even of hybridity. The Iron Curtain did not cover the shame of a dictatorship regime in Spain, and yet, authors like Baroja describe that atmosphere at a great extent, even, as this paper wants to show, anticipates the Cold War psycho-social atmosphere. Authors like Levinas, on the other hand, provide a philosophical and theoretical frame to understand better both the Cold War period and the literary experimentation of Iberian authors towards the concept of the Other. In this piece, I discuss the proximity of the notion of the Other in Levinas and Baroja, and contrast this approach with the canonical vision of Baroja in Iberian literature",

In this paper I attempt a survey of female characters in Naipaul's fiction across his whole career to establish to what extent this reputation is justified, and whether his harsh treatment of some female characters is matched by equally critical attitudes to male characters. While early conditioning has given Naipaul a traditional view of women’s roles, he cannot be said to show a consistent dislike of women, as his female characters range from the admirable to the repugnant in the same way as his male characters do.

    "summary": "This work critiques Alan Goldman's \"Philosophy and the Novel,\" appreciating his methodological stance while offering three critical thoughts. The author, Richard Eldridge, explores how specific novels achieve their philosophical insights and discusses the role of reading experiences in character formation. Eldridge also emphasizes the importance of authorial stances, characterized by heightened attentiveness and horror, as objects of readerly engagement. The text suggests that the formal and thematic achievements of novels can symbolize and stand for alternative ways of life, even amid bleak subject matter. Keywords: Alan Goldman, Philosophy and the Novel, literary criticism, authorial stance, readerly engagement, character formation, literary philosophy."

    "abstract": "The mother/daughter bond is the central subject of Amy Tan’s two powerful books, The Joy\r\nLuck Club and The Bonesetter’s Daughter. Tensions that arise in the novels between a Chinese\r\nmother and her Chinese-American daughter are often described by the critics as being the\r\nresult of two important factors. One is based on the misunderstandings caused by the\r\ngenerational gap, while the other comes from the cultural gap. For a Chinese-born mother the\r\nAmerican reality instigates various confusions, as she still views her life with the eyes of her\r\ntraditional Chinese upbringing. On the other hand, her daughter lacks any profound\r\nknowledge about her Chinese ethnicity, which makes her unable to recognize the influences of\r\nher mother’s Chinese past over their relationship. But in her novels Tan portrays also the\r\nrelationship between the Chinese immigrant mother and her mother in China. Their\r\nrelationship, which grew up exclusively on the grounds of the Chinese culture, is\r\ncharacterized by empathy and appreciation. In this paper I am going to discuss the change\r\nthat occurred to the mother-daughter relationship after it has been replanted into a different\r\ncultural context. The line of argument will reveal in what ways the mother-daughter\r\nrelationship underwent a significant transformation",

    "abstract": "Dorothy L. Sayers created in her fictional character Lord Peter Wimsey a “contrasexual” figure in her own imagination, with whom she carried on an extended dialogue over many years. C.G. Jung's concept of the contrasexual archetype, the anima (in men) or the animus (in women), can provide a very useful tool for investigating the presence of this transgendered voice within the self. Specifically in relation to Sayers and her Wimsey, Jung's theory can uncover the successful conversion of a potentially “bad animus” into a positive one, or, in other words, Sayers's successful creation in herself of her own “masculine” voice to replace the harmful voice of the patriarchy. Not unlike Hélène Cixous's concept of the “other bisexuality,” the contrasexual element in Sayers provides a model too for her readers to “speak woman” in a full or rounded way",

    "abstract": "This thesis examines the concept of identity in the novel Lady Audley’s Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon. In the mid to late Victorian period, self-definition was strongly tied to gender roles. Men were expected to be mentally active, physical strong, and morally guiding leaders of society, and women were to be their passive, pious, domestically minded followers. These expectations for behavior were so strong that those breaking them were in danger of being considered insane. In Braddon’s novel, the behavior of most characters does not align with the expectations for their gender. The exception is Lady Audley, the apparently ideal woman whose beauty and charm mask a vicious and criminal nature. Her plea of insanity, while it may offer an excuse for her unfeminine behavior, does not pardon her crimes. However, hero Robert Audley’s behavior is absolutely effeminate, but he has a strong moral sense and total devotion to his loved ones. Their deviation from or adherence to gender-appropriate behaviors does not change their essential natures. In Lady Audley’s Secret, Braddon uses gender roles and the theme of insanity to critique the Victorian conception of identity",

It explores how societal expectations for men and women's behavior were deeply intertwined with self-definition, and how deviations could lead to accusations of madness. The study analyzes characters like Lady Audley, whose apparent feminine ideal masks criminality, and Robert Audley, whose 'effeminate' behavior contradicts Victorian norms yet is coupled with strong morals.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the corporate reform of UK higher education and its implications for drama. The paper first sets out the background to this reform and its ideological reference points. It then outlines the discourse surrounding the foundation of drama in British Universities and relates this to the discourse developed several decades later by performance studies. In mapping out these areas, the paper draws attention to drama academics’ professed emphasis on rejecting commodification in favour of multiple and/or wide-ranging practices, progressive and democratic principles and a concern with the complexity of human beings. The paper argues that corporate discourse cuts at the joints of drama’s identity as a discipline because what constitute many of the ‘professed’ principles and modes of practice within drama and performance studies are antithetical to the models of commodification promoted by corporate thinking. The paper also engages with the ethical issues raised by corporate reform. As a wide range of critics point out, allowing corporate discourse and practices to dominate higher education is problematic because of the extent to which these practices do violence to the human and promote antidemocratic, antisocial, dehumanising and alienating modes of governance. The paper notes that, while drama’s ‘old’ discourses may seem contradictory, problematic or even to collude with élitism/corporatism, they can nevertheless help us clarify our understanding of the institutional place of drama in contemporary higher education, as remembering the democratic and progressive in drama’s past - as well as acknowledging where it has colluded with the corporate agenda - provides us with a means both to contextualize policy reform and engage critically with its implications",

    "abstract": "While there is a growing body of literature on relational pedagogy as a concept, less attention is given to the details of just how relational pedagogy manifests in classroom practice. Similarly, while issues of power, democracy and co-constructed learning feature in contemporary research, the details of how power relationships can be effectively altered between teachers and children warrants closer scrutiny. This paper explores how pedagogy is enhanced when spaces are negotiated between teachers and children in the real and fictional worlds of drama. The findings emerge from a two year collaborative research project between generalist elementary teachers and university researchers. Salient issues of trust, power sharing, and metaxis, which are part of relational pedagogy in the drama classroom, are explored. In particular, the paper discusses how traditional power and knowledge positions are 'disrupted' through the drama strategy of 'teacher-in-role' - a strategy with both political significance and pedagogical force",

One of these is DRAMA, a multiband protocol based on broadband technology. It provides dynamic allocation of bandwidth among clusters of nodes in the total network. A number of traffic placement policies for such networks are proposed and evaluated. Metrics used for performance evaluation include average network access delay, degree of fairness of access among the nodes, and network throughput. The feasibility of the DRAMA protocol is established through simulation studies. DRAMA provides effective integration of synchronous and asychronous traffic due to its ability to separate traffic types. Under the suggested traffic placement policies, the DRAMA protocol is shown to handle diverse loads, mixes of traffic types, and numbers of nodes, as well as modifications to the network structure and momentary traffic overloads",

    "summary": "This piece re-examines Bertolt Brecht's contributions to drama education and pedagogic thought, moving beyond his conventional portrayal as a cultural icon. The authors propose that a Brechtian conceptual framework, emphasizing critical production and audiences, remains relevant to contemporary cultural production. This approach aims to elevate drama education beyond traditional views, which either categorize it as moral and social education focused on universal truths or as a collection of formal and critical techniques. The study suggests using Brecht's ideas to foster critical engagement in drama."

    "abstract": "This article traces the first generation of writers of songs and drama in Nanjing who emerged from the anonymous context of early Ming court entertainment and established their name and reputation in the second half of the fifteenth century. These writers—Shi Zhong (1437-after 1516), Chen Duo (1454?-1507?), and Xu Lin (1462-1538)—represented a different mode of writing songs and drama. For them it was no longer a professional occupation, as in the case of the court performers, but became part of their cultural and social life. The extent to which our knowledge of these first generation qu writers depends on local sources and on acts of remembrance by later Nanjing authors is also examined",

    "abstract": "A progressive growth in literature was seen significantly during Victorian period. These decades also saw an overdue revival of drama, in which the existence of drama was started to improve when entering late of Victorian period. Along with that situation, Thomas William Robertson (1829-1871) emerged as a popular drama writer at that time besides the coming of Henrik Ibsen's works in 1880's. However, Robertson's popularity was defeated by other dramatists during late of Victorian period (1880-1901), drama writer like Oscar Wilde (1854-1900). Beside Wilde, there were several well known dramatists during late of Victorian period. Dramatists as Shaw, Jones, and Pinero were also influential toward the development of drama at that time. In the discussion of English drama development, role of late Victorian period's dramatists was really important toward the development of modern drama. Their works and efforts really influenced the triumph of realism and development of drama after Victorian period ended. Therefore, the development of drama during late of Victorian period is discussed in this particular writing, due to the important roles of dramatist such as Wilde, Shaw, Pinero, and Jones. Here, their roles to the revival of English drama and the trend of realism in the history of English literature are very important",

The relationships between the participants in the drama, teacher and pupils, both in and out of role are explored.

In so doing, it makes no apology for standing on the shoulders of Peter Meredith's work on the N-Town manuscript, and with John Tailby on the texts and documents illustrating the variety of staging of religious drama across Europe, as well as Meg Twycross's work on devisor Felsted of London, all of which demonstrate that this material has been available in the public domain for some years. Just as the N-Town Plays were still believed in some quarters to come from Coventry as late as the mid-twentieth century, although Francis Douce knew they did not almost 150 years earlier, so too the domination of modern understandings about English mystery plays has remained wedded to the model of four ‘cycles’ promulgated in the 1970s, despite the accumulation of evidence to the contrary. Peter Meredith's edition of The ‘Passion Play’ from the N. Town Manuscript is now all but unobtainable, and the volumes of Records of Early English Drama are the chosen bedtime reading of few, so here we revisit some texts and records to explore afresh one aspect of an already shifted paradigm",

    "abstract": "Purpose – This purpose of this paper is to describe a collaborative project from the University of Waikato, Hamilton New Zealand, in which the authors used process drama to engage final year teaching students with complex issues of cultural diversity, enabling them to “grow into” different kinds of leadership positions in an imagined educational setting. The paper describes the project and makes a case for process drama as a means of providing opportunities for leadership and as a potent tool for learning about issues of social justice. Design/methodology/approach – The drama was based on a fictional scenario described by Hall and Bishop, where a beginner teacher (of European descent) unwittingly diminishes the experiences of Maori and other non-European children in her class. Using a three-phase process planning model and with facilitators in role alongside the students, the drama explored the scenario from all points of view. Students were encouraged to build empathy for the beginner teacher and for the children and also to explore the dilemma faced by the teacher's tutor in deciding whether, and how, to confront the teacher on the issue. Findings – Through the drama, students built a sense of empathy for all sides of the issue and engaged in deep thinking about the experience of cultural exclusion. The safety and distance provided by the drama “frame” spurred students to take leadership roles and “stand up” for issues of social justice. The authors suggest that through such dramas students gain skills and perspectives that they may carry into their professional lives. Research limitations/implications – The paper describes a small project, over one lesson with a specific group of students. More research is needed into the effectiveness of process drama as a sustained strategy for teacher education. Originality/value – This scenario explored in the drama has currency in Aotearoa New Zealand, where the population is increasingly culturally diverse, where underachievement of Maori students continues to be of concern, and where research has shown the centrality of teacher-student relations in raising educational achievement for Maori. The authors believe this paper makes a compelling case for the value of drama as a tool for student teachers to encounter social justice issues in a meaningful way, and suggest that the paper is a valuable contribution to more than one discipline, as it straddles the fields of professional practice and drama as pedagogy",

It emphasizes its utility for media and creative writing students, providing foundational knowledge for understanding and future contributions to the genre. Key areas include television drama, crime genre, media studies, and creative writing."

The author uses a specially crafted example and a typical textbook scenario to illustrate the pervasive use of incorrect priors in standard statistical practice. It highlights how information geometry can construct objectively meaningful prior distributions, showing that naive diffuse priors can be significantly less efficient than Jeffreys' rule. The paper discusses Bayesian inference's susceptibility to wrong priors, examining logistic regression with naive versus uniform priors over the manifold, and proposes a family of priors that maximizes ignorance, suggesting a path forward with more geometry. Keywords include Information Geometry, Volume Prior, and Bayesian Inference."

    "title": "Contemporary life as revealed in recent Irish drama",
    "abstract": "Thesis (M.A.)--Boston UniversityContemporary Life as Revealed in Recent Irish Drama is a compilation and discussion of the various aspects of contemporary Irish life as expressed in plays by Irish dramatists, John M. Synge, Paul V. Carroll, Lennox Robinson, Sean O'Casey, and Seumas O'Brien. \nThe work begins with a statement of the purpose of the thesis and the methods used. Chapter I covers the history of the development of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, with the following features discussed: The purpose of the organization shows that the Abbey Theatre was first and foremost a theatrical, not a literary movement. Many dramatists of ability, and at least one, John M. Synge, of genius, was discovered. Most of the founders were bound together by their enthusiasm. \nThe next feature of this theatrical movement was the foreign influence, in which is revealed Antoine's revolt against the Parisian Theatre in 1887 and the London Independent Theatre in 1891. \nThen the national influence on this theatrical organization is presented with the following aspects: A new interest in Gaelic sprung up with the formation of a Gaelic League in 1893, followed by the formation of an Irish Literary Theatre in Dublin, in which Lady Gregory, William B. Yeats, Edward Martyn, and George Moore were particularly active. The Countess Cathleen was presented in 1894, and soon afterwards the formation of the first company of Irish actors came. This group chose Deirdre as the first play to be presented in St. Teresa's Temperance Society Hall. \nNext came the formation of the Irish National Theatre in 1902, of which William B. Yeats was president. The Hour-Glass and Twenty-Five were presented with success, and the Dublin Press became more friendly. \nThis chapter ends with a presentation of the best year of this theatre group, in which John M. Synge was discovered as a playwright, Sara Allgood, as an outstanding actress, and Miss Horniman of England, as a fine patron, who offered to invest in an Irish theatre. The play Deirdre was revived in 1903, and this producti on was followed by Riders to the Sea. In this year, theater fire regulations were so tightened that many Dublin buildings were closed. Then Mechanics Institute was taken over as a theater by the group under Miss Horniman's sponsorship. This place was called the Abbey Theatre, the first repertory theater in the world. On February, 1905, J. E. Synge's The Well of the Saints was produced. \nAs John M. Synge links chapter one, which covers the history of The Abbey Theatre, with the more modern Irish dramatists, it seemed fitting to have chapter two present his view of peasant life in Wicklow, in which the following features are given: The fair and the tinkers. \nThe next chapter discusses the country life in Western Ireland as presented by Lennox Robinson. The first play, The Whiteheaded Boy produced in 1921, reveals the middle class life, in which the follov1ing features were stressed: The matches, through which many marriages in Ireland have been arranged by the parents or older brothers of the families. In line with this problem of marriage arrangement is the place that the favorite son in the Irish family holds. Then come the pretensions and love of imitation that are found in this group of society which is especially affected by repertory players from the city. A picture of hotel life and country humor terminates this discusion of middle class life. \nThe next phase of life in Western Ireland is that of the gentry, that Robinson reveals in his play, Killycreggs in Twilight, in which are found these various characteristics: The gentry pride, their pretensions, their tragedies. \nThe following chapter presents the rectory life in Ireland as revealed in Paul V. Carroll's plays, Shadow and Substance and The White Steed, produced respectively in 1937 and 1939, which introduce us to the following features: The modern Canon, his country curates, the rectory housekeeper, the village school which the Canon dominates; the village school master, the old-fashioned Canon, who disapproves of the vigilant committees, the native's love of country, the home of an Irish peasant, and a countryman's view of Dublin. \nThe final chapter, which depicts Sean O'Casey's view of the tenement life of Dublin, where he was reared, is divided into three parts. The first section concerns tenement life in Dublin from 1915 to 1916, and The Plough and The Stars gives us a pictures of that class of society. The following phases are presented: The tenement dweller's reaction to his surroundings and his desire to improve his conditions. Then comes a description of a typical tenement with the resulting ravages of disease on the people of this area, caused by the lack of sunshine, proper food and care. Amid the tribulations is found the strong faith of these dwellers. A wake and funeral are sadly described amid the street-fighting in the district. Then comes a description of landmarks in Dublin where much of this fighting occurred. A revelation of the means of transportation, the humor of the people amid strife, and the tenement landlord and his problems complete part one of this phase of Irish life. \nThe second part of this chapter presents tenement life in Dublin from 1917 to 1923. Sean O'Casey's observations of tenement life in 1922 is first presented, followed by Padraic Colum's comments on Dublin of that era. Then appears a description of the various types of characters found in this district of Dublin: the militarists, the street vendors, and a typical tenement neighbor. \nThen the third part of this final chapter gives a view of modern tenement life in Dublin with the following aspects: The poetic workman of modern Dublin's tenement life, who desires to improve his mind even though he has had no benefit of formal education. Next are found O'Casey's criticism of the housing conditions in Dublin with their dubious activities. Then follows a description of the street vendors and their threat, because of their poor working conditions, to the safety of the city. The final picture presented is that of an Irish mother, whom O'Casey has described with love and pity, for she has sacrificed so much during her life for her children. This mother in reality represents his own mother, to whom he owes so much, in his autobiography, I Knock at the Door",

    "title": "Queen Caroline’s pains and penalties: Silence and speech in the dramatic art of British women’s suffrage",
    "abstract": "In Britain, the act that launched the militant campaign of the suffragettes in 1905 was the interruption of a political meeting in Manchester. The violent silencing and arrest of the women ensued. The women’s suffrage campaigns in Britain became more vigorous in the early twentieth century. They frequently foregrounded the oppressive silencing of women in their political speeches at public meetings, in newspapers, and in the courts. Having deliberately sought arrest, some militant suffrage activists exploited the arena of the court room to expound on their political position. In various audacious and spectacular ways, the exclusion of women from the democratic process was challenged, not least by a sustained attack on the legal system. Drama, one of the more successful cultural forms of protest, was often used to expose the inequities of the existing social fabric, and as an aesthetic form it deploys the body as well as the voice. This paper will examine the forceful, anti-rhetorical function of silence in British women’s suffrage drama from the early twentieth century, focusing on the appropriation of Queen Caroline (1768–1821) as a silent proto-suffragette in Pains and Penalties, a play about her trial, written by Laurence Housman (1865–1959) and directed by Edith Craig for the Pioneer Players theatre society",

The paper argues that the first and most significant shaping of curriculum is in response to the ideological and political imperatives of the government in power and that this shaping shifts in response to shifts in the field of power. However, the paper argues for maintaining a critical and pro-social pedagogy as the core of any drama curriculum whatever its technical appearance might be. This pedagogy is identified through the two cases and placed in a wider context of pedagogic and artistic thought and practice with the suggestion that by better understanding how the rich traditions of drama and theatre education sit within a broader struggle to give young people pro-social and critical pedagogic and artistic opportunities, drama can strengthen its resolve during periods of curriculum reform",

It notes the scarcity of contemporary theoretical writings on the period's drama, contrasting it with modern critical claims about themes such as changing gender roles, marriage, class issues, nationalistic anxieties, and xenophobia. The analysis proposes a division of Victorian Gothic drama into early (1820-50), middle, and late periods for a more structured approach. This work contributes to understanding the evolution and thematic concerns within Victorian theatrical productions and can be useful for semantic searches on Gothic literature, Victorian theatre, and genre studies."

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the interactive experiences constructed for users of the New Zealand online interactive drama Reservoir Hill (2009, 2010), focusing both on the nature and levels of engagement which the series provided to users and the difficulties of audience research into this kind of media content. The series itself provided tightly prescribed forms of interactivity across multiple platforms, allowing forms of engagement that were greatly appreciated by its audience overall but actively explored only by a small proportion of users. The responses from members of the Reservoir Hill audience suggests that online users themselves are still learning the nature of, and constraints on, their engagements with various forms of online interactive media. This paper also engages with issue of how interactivity itself is defined, the difficulties of both connecting with audience members and securing timely access to online data, and the challenges of undertaking collaborative research with media producers in order to gain access to user data",

    "title": "Drama and the representation of affect: structures of feeling and signs of learning",
    "abstract": "The way in which school students represent affective aspects of human relationships in drama and what this reveals about learning in drama is the focus of this paper. Such an enquiry traverses the borders between affect, intellect and physicality. Affect and its representation in drama have been themes in the history of drama and theatre and is a current concern in the field of applied theatre and drama. Writers on drama in schools have hitherto been mostly concerned with affect in terms of feelings experienced and emotions represented by students participating in drama. There has, however, been little theorisation of what students’ representation of affective human relations might reveal about the complexity of learning processes involved. Cultural theories of representation and learning are related to an example, drawn from field notes, of school student drama in which students present a stylised representation of a relationship. Because affect is intimately connected with both the bodilyness and modes of representation in drama, multimodal social semiotic analysis will be used as one component of a framework to draw attention to the body as a principal material and tool for making meaning in drama. Theoretically, explanations of learning will be taken from the work of Vygotsky, who maintained a lifelong interest in both drama and learning and the relationship between the two. Concepts taken from the cultural theories of Raymond Williams are also referred to – specifically to the ways in which cultural activity and artefacts represent ‘structures of feeling’",

Dari hasil kuesioner dan wawancara dengan mahasiswa Program Studi Sastra Tionghoa, faktor terbesar yang membuat mereka ingin belajar bahasa Tionghoa adalah jalan cerita, bahasa Tionghoa itu sendiri, dan aktor/aktris dalam drama televisi Taiwan. Selain itu menonton drama Taiwan dapat membantu mereka dalam belajar grammar, listening, speaking, hanzi, pelafalan, dan shengdiao.

In talking of a pedagogy of theatre I will borrow from the late John McGrath’s use of the term a ‘learning paedia’ which he succinctly distils into two main features:\n\nAccuracy – the audience must recognise and accept the emotional and social veracity of what is happening on stage, must identify with the core situation, whatever styly may be used to present it.\n\nRelevance – the core situation must reflect the central, most profound realities of its time, must speak to its audiences about a truth that matters in their lives, whether social, moral, political, emotional or individual I (McGrath 2002, p. 138)\n\nTo these features of truthfulness and relevance he adds the core principle that theatre should use all possible means to reach every citizen and not act as ‘an excluding agency, whether by the price of its tickets, the manner of its box office staff, its location or its impenetrability’ (ibid. p.139)",

Involving 40 fifth-grade students from two schools over two months, the research found a significant improvement in drama mastery, with pretest scores in the 'less' category rising to 'sufficient' posttest. Both teacher and student activities also showed improvement from 'sufficient' to 'very good.' The study concludes that this model is effective for drama instruction in Indonesian language subjects and recommends collaboration between schools and professional art studios to integrate practical drama training with theoretical learning."

The project aims were multiple and interconnected. We extended a language acquisition framework established by the Dutch investigators in previous collaborations with the Universities of Venice and Southampton, and combined this with an investigation of ways to harness technology in order to teach Australian students to communicate with and about their art. The Dutch language students were prompted to develop art-related language literacy (description, interpretation, criticism), through live, video-streamed interaction with drama students in Australia at critical points in the development of a group-devised performance (conception, rehearsal, performance). The Australian student improved their capacity to articulate the aims and processes which drove their art-making by illuminating the art-making process for the Dutch students, and providing them with a real-life context for the use of extended vocabulary whilst making them partners in the process of shaping the work. All participants engaged in the common task of assessing the capacity of the art work produced to communicate meaning to a non-Australian audience.<br /",

    "abstract": "(Forthcoming in PMLA, January 2018) Discussions of the relationship between drama and performance have been\ndominated by two symmetrical, emancipatory impulses. Performance scholars have, for the past\nhalf-century, sought to liberate performance from the authority of the drama. Literary scholars\nhave, for centuries if not millennia, sought to distinguish a “literary” dimension of the dramatic\ntext free of the flux of performance. This essay diagnoses in Shakespeare’s Hamlet an alternative\nstory about the relationship between drama and performance. Paying refreshed attention to the\nearlier and less famous of Hamlet’s statements of dramatic theory—his blurb for the “excellent\nplay” featuring Aeneas’ speech to Dido—I find Hamlet bringing drama, especially in its\n“literary” dimension, crashing back into performance. This collision does not reinstitute the\nauthority of the text; rather, it radically democratizes the scene of dramatic performance by\n“indigesting” the behaviors of the participants therein",

    "summary": "This essay re-examines the relationship between drama and performance, challenging the traditional view that seeks to liberate performance from the dramatic text or a 'literary' dimension from performance flux. Focusing on Shakespeare's Hamlet, particularly his early dramatic theory as expressed in the Aeneas-Dido speech, the author argues that Hamlet integrates the literary aspect of drama directly into performance. This integration doesn't reassert textual authority but rather democratizes the dramatic performance by 'digesting' the participants' behaviors. This analysis offers an alternative perspective on drama-performance dynamics, relevant for performance studies and literary criticism."

    "abstract": "Tein opinnäytetyöni aiheesta ”Sairaan kaunis Minä – draaman mahdollisuudet syömishäiriöön sairastu-neiden vertaistukiryhmässä”. Opinnäytetyöni kehittämistehtävänä on havainnoida, miten draama toimii välineenä syömishäiriöön sairastuneiden vertaistukiryhmässä ja miten draama menetelmänä toimii kun-toutumisen tukena. Lisäksi tavoitteena oli, että ryhmään osallistuva henkilö kokisi voimaantumisen tun-netta.\n\nOpinnäytetyöni toiminnallinen osuus oli Draamapaja, joka oli suunnattu syömishäiriöstä kokemuksia omaaville henkilöille. Draamapaja oli luonteeltaan vertaistukiryhmä ja ryhmän toimintaväline oli draama ja toiminnalliset teatterilähtöiset menetelmät. Draamapaja kokoontui tammi- ja helmikuun 2014 aikana kolme kertaa Kotkassa. Ensimmäisellä kerralla ryhmään osallistui kolme henkilöä, kahdella viimeisellä kerralla oli yksi henkilö, kahden lopetettua. Vertaistukiryhmän ohjaajana roolini oli enemmänkin toimia ryhmän innostaja eikä niinkään ryhmän ohjaajana.\n\nDraaman menetelmät kuntoutumisen tukena olivat toimivia ja sopivat syömishäiriöön sairastuneiden vertaistukiryhmässä käytettäväksi. Toiminnalliset teatterilähtöiset menetelmät tukivat yhdessä vertaistuen kanssa yksilöä hyvin ja ekspressiivinen ilmaisu sopii osaksi kuntoutumisen tukea. Draamapajaan osallis-tunut nainen oli tyytyväinen toimintaan ja hän koki, että draaman menetelmien avulla hänen voimaantu-misprosessi oli alkanut.I made my thesis about ”Sickly beautiful Me – the opportunities of drama in the peer support group for people who had suffered from eating disorder”. The development task in my thesis is to observe how drama works as a method in a peer group and how drama works as part of rehab. The functional part in my thesis was a Drama Workshop and it was also a development task to observe whether a person in the Drama Workshop can attain a feeling of empowerment. \n\nThe Drama Workshop was a peer support group and the method that was used was drama. The Drama Workshop had three meetings in January and February in 2014. At the first meeting there were three per-sons and at the last two meetings there was only one person. My role in the group was to be like an inspir-er more than a group leader.  \n\nThe methods of drama are useful. With that and the peer support a person can have support in life. Also the expressive methods are a suitable part of the rehab. ”The Drama Workshop has touched me on a very personal level. We have got to the pith of my feelings. I love drama and yeah, drama works.” – Woman in the Drama Work shop",

    "abstract": "Consumers have traditionally looked for products that could fulfill their needs and retailers responded to demand by initially adopting product-oriented, and then more recently, customer-oriented strategies. This shift was heavily underpinned by technology, which enabled retailers to implement more intelligent approaches that evolved around consumers based on their profiles. The next step in this transformation is now towards a “unique” experience creation, with retailers providing a retail theater experience that is different and special and consumers enjoying an increased opportunity to interact and participate in the overall experience. In this paper, we examine how metaverses, i.e. Internet-based virtual worlds, and more specifically Second Life, can potentially provide the stage for this retail theater experience. Our discussion takes place in the context of two cases that are used to highlight the implications of retail theater for both consumers and retailers and illustrate the opportunities and challenges they face",

    "abstract": "The law and literature movement has been with us long enough that it is now possible to speak seriously of a  literary analysis of law,  just as it has become possible, and even standard, to speak of an  economic analysis of law.  It is also standard, of course, to speak of that abstract character who has emerged from the economic analysis of law:  economic man.  In these brief comments, I want to offer one contrast of the  economic man  that emerges from economic legal analysis with the  literary person  that is beginning to emerge from literary legal analysis. I will sometimes call the latter person, in the interest of rough justice and somewhat in the interest of accuracy,  literary woman.  The  literary woman  posited by literary legal theorists is coming into her own, and she is at least beginning to operate as a check on the excesses of economic man run wild.\nI should add by way of caveat that these comments are intended to be programmatic and tentative. I am not suggesting, and do not believe, that the comparative vision of literary woman that contrasts with economic man and which I will describe in this essay is the only, or even the most, representative vision of humanity and human nature that has emerged from the law and literature movement. I do think, though, that it is a vision we ought to pursue. The idealized literary person, sometimes explicit, but most often implicit in much of our literary legal analysis, stands in sharp contrast to her closest interdisciplinary cousin, economic man. For that reason alone, the vision of human nature she represents has tremendous moral promise. We ought to begin to make good on it",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to present a sociology of literary studies that is distinguished from the sociology of literature in that its focus is on literary studies as a social practice rather than as a socio-cultural institution: how literary studies is institutionalized as such not how it functions in relation to literature. The sociological analysis of literary studies in this paper entails two tasks. Firstly, it constructs a methodological frame within which literary studies can be observed and analysed in terms of the rules of discursive formation rather than as a pre-discursive entity. This is achieved through conceptualizing the Foucauldian notion of discursive formation and knowledge practice as an analytic strategy and operationalising it via Paul Dowling's Social Activity Method. Empirically, the analysis produces a description of the practice of literary studies as instantiated in the particular region of the practice constituted with what I refer to as the crisis discourse. The analysis describes literary studies as that which is emergent upon differing institutionalising strategies articulated by its participants to mark out literary studies from other practices and to maintain its disciplinarity through regulating the distribution and the access of the distribution of the discourse within and beyond the practice. The generalisability of the research in this paper lies in the applicability of the analytical method that can be employed at any given level of analysis to examine discursive practiceâ€”such as literary studiesâ€”as the effects of the particular discourses in terms of how they articulate and sustain the institutionalised identity of the practice.Sociology of Literature, Sociology of Literary Studies, Cultural Studies, Sociology of Knowledge, Foucault, Discursive Formation, Social Activity Method, Disciplinarity, Institutionalisation, Research Methodology",

The research establishes a comprehensive presentation of literary representations of Richard I, then questions the motives for authors' characterizations to understand the political and cultural biases driving the Third Crusade and its modern interpretations. Key entities include Richard I, Third Crusade, Mediterranean History, literary sources, Western authors, Muslim authors."

    "title": "A 'novel' approach to leadership development : using women's literary fiction to explore contemporary women's leadership issues : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Business Studies in Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand",
    "abstract": "The central aim of this thesis is to investigate how women’s literary fiction can be harnessed for the purpose of exploring contemporary women’s leadership issues. This thesis argues that literary fiction is a valuable source of interdisciplinary and ‘artful’ consciousness-raising material for proactively addressing at the interpersonal level a wide range of critical concerns related to women’s leadership experiences. Having identified a significant ‘gap’ in the extant literature – the underutilisation of women’s novels, short-stories and plays in leadership studies – this thesis adopts an interdisciplinary approach to demonstrate how literary works can be used to examine women’s contemporary leadership issues.\r\nFor this research project I adopted an interpretive qualitative research paradigm informed by critical leadership studies and a multiplicity of feminist perspectives. I developed a systematic method for long listing and short listing appropriate texts and analysed selected works in response to a five-point conceptual framework of critical concerns arising from a review of the women and leadership literature. I also kept a reflective blog to track the iterative nature of the research process and to record my learning during this study.\r\nThe findings demonstrate that women’s literary fiction offers a rich repository of thought-provoking illustrations of women’s leadership concerns, including gender binaries, power-play, socially constructed perceptions and gendered expectations, and women’s diverse range experiences as both leaders and followers. The extended analysis provides a number of in-depth examples and reflective questions, revealing myriad opportunities for critical theorising, illustrative analysis and critical reflection. Subsequently, this thesis argues that fictional stories are a viable and potentially transformative ‘artful’ intervention for addressing complex leadership issues concerned with gender within the context of women’s leadership development programmes. My recommendations for future studies include a focus on ethical leadership, the evaluation of participant ‘book club’ interventions and an extension of the reading lists to include more culturally relevant New Zealand authors.\r\nTo my knowledge, there are no studies that utilise women’s literary fiction for the purpose of exploring contemporary women’s leadership concerns and questions. Consequently, my thesis makes an original contribution to the leadership and humanities field, as well as providing an innovative and creative product that can be used for critical and interdisciplinary approaches to women’s leadership development",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we compute the affective-aesthetic potential (AAP) of literary texts by using a simple sentiment analysis tool called SentiArt. In contrast to other established tools, SentiArt is based on publicly available vector space models (VSMs) and requires no emotional dictionary, thus making it applicable in any language for which VSMs have been made available (>150 so far) and avoiding issues of low coverage. In a first study, the AAP values of all words of a widely used lexical databank for German were computed and the VSM’s ability in representing concrete and more abstract semantic concepts was demonstrated. In a second study, SentiArt was used to predict ~2800 human word valence ratings and shown to have a high predictive accuracy (R2 > 0.5, p < 0.0001). A third study tested the validity of SentiArt in predicting emotional states over (narrative) time using human liking ratings from reading a story. Again, the predictive accuracy was highly significant: R2adj = 0.46, p < 0.0001, establishing the SentiArt tool as a promising candidate for lexical sentiment analyses at both the micro- and macrolevels, i.e., short and long literary materials. Possibilities and limitations of lexical VSM-based sentiment analyses of diverse complex literary texts are discussed in the light of these results",

What is it that Romantic thinkers and writers do? Why does what they do matter? Is Romanticism a think of the past?  These challenging essays defend Romanticism against its critics. They argue that Romantic thought, interpreted as the ongoing pursuit of freedom in concrete contexts, crossed by frustration and marked by desire, remains a central and exemplary form of both artistic work and philosophical understanding. Marshaling a wide range of texts from literature, philosophy, and criticism, Richard Eldridge traces the central themes and stylistic features of Romantic thinking in the work of Kant, Holderlin, Wordsworth, Hardy, Wittgenstein, Cavell, and Updike. Through his analysis he shows that Romanticism is neither emptily literary and escapist nor dogmatically optimistic and sentimental.   This philosophical defense of the ideals and practice of Romanticism will appeal particularly to all professionals and students in philosophy, literature, and aesthetics who are interested in expressivist thinking about value and freedom, as it is developed in both literary and philosophical texts",

Throughout the process, Shabkar evokes deities and historical figures that are fundamental to Tibetan historical, cultural, and religious memory and alludes to customs and tropes central to Tibetan culture, such as orality, song, and the bardic tradition.

I will demonstrate how the chronotope might be used in the study of literary adaptation by examining the relationships between Daniel Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe”, its historical sources, and Michel Tournier’s twentieth-century adaptation of the Robinson story, “Friday”. My analysis draws upon three of the semantic levels of the chronotope presented in the introduction to this volume: (1) chronotopic motifs linked to two opposing themes: enthusiasm for European colonial expansionism and skepticism regarding the supremacy of European culture; (2) major chronotopes that determine the narrative structure of a text; and (3) the way in which such major chronotopes may be linked to broader questions of genre",

    "abstract": "The essay examines the influence of Czeslaw Milosz on Seamus Heaney's writing, focusing primarily on the early 1980s, which was a period of major transition in Heaney's literary and academic career, following the success of Field Work (1979) in the USA and his appointment as a Visiting Lecturer at Harvard. It establishes the political and biographical contexts for Heaney's reception of Milosz's prose and poetry, and discusses the importance of Milosz's Nobel Lecture and his memoir, Native Realm, in fostering Heaney's feelings of affinity and sense of difference. Composed in the wake of Solidarity's challenge to the post-war status quo, Milosz's reflections in the Nobel Lecture on history, art, and the artist's responsibilities had a profound resonance for his fellow exile, uncertain as he was how to address the Hunger Strikes in the collection he was working on, Station Island. The essay thus explores the range of factors which resulted in Milosz becoming The Master to Heaney, and ends offering an analysis of his poem of that title. It draws on a range of literary and historical sources, including the Heaney archives at Emory, Atlanta. Since it is the centenary of Milosz's birth, it offers a timely reminder of his importance in world literature.

Such  negative  imageability,  the  essay suggests,  was self-perpetuating, since authors  would be  influenced by their reading to create literary worlds repeating existing tropes; these literary representations, in turn, influenced readers’ perceptions of the area.Intertextual, multi-layered and polysensorial geocritical readings,the essay concludes, can producepowerful  andnuanced  pictures  of  literary  placesbut also  face  a formidable challenge in defining an adequate geocentric corpus",

It discusses the spatial turn in Humanities and various spatial critical approaches, mapping literary Clerkenwell through genre hybridity, intertextuality, cartography, public perception, and transgression. Clerkenwell is shown to have inspired diverse genre fiction, often defining the district by its negative associations with crime, poverty, and incarceration. The essay suggests this negative image was self-perpetuating, influencing authors and readers' perceptions. It concludes that intertextual, multi-layered geocritical readings offer nuanced pictures of literary places but face challenges in defining an adequate geocentric corpus. Keywords: geocriticism, Clerkenwell, Victorian fiction, spatial turn, literary geography."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the integration of e-learning in creative writing. The online approach to the teaching of creative writing takes into account today’s Malaysian youth and their fascination with computer technology. It is this appeal of innovation in electronics and knowledge that leads an educator to design an on-line approach to a creative writing course. The theoretical construct used to support the discussion is Anderson’s theory that on-line learning is knowledge-, community-, assessment-, and learner-centered. The writer, who is also the course developer, analyses a poetry-writing activity, which students undertake, and the e-portfolio used in the course. To analyze the processes involved in this creative writing exercise Macherey’s (1978) Theory of Literary Production is adapted and utilized. This theory, which regards literary production as a process imitating that of a production line, provides the methodology and conceptual framework for analyzing the raw materials collected by the students and their transformation during the writing process. This paper thus addresses the benefits of e-learning in a creative writing context",

    "abstract": "Background. A growing interest in discursive nature of Nobel lectures resulted in a number of studies which emphasize their rhetorical force to influence public opinion and to popularize ideas in different spheres of human life. Analyzing Literature Laureates’ lectures, most researchers focus on linguistic means and the personality of the Nobelist himself/herself. However, characteristics of a writer proper have not been dealt with indepth. This article maintains our previous study, which indicates a close relationship between the content component of the Nobel lecture and the laureate’ outlook; the lecture itself can be regarded as a brief but extremely powerful expression of his/her human and professional qualities.\n          \n          Purpose. The aim of this paper is to examine how literature laureates interpret the notion of a writer in their Nobel lectures and to identify main common themes in creating this collective image.\n          \n          Methods. A method of linguistic description and observation, a descriptive method, and a contextual-interpretation method were employed to analyse the sample of 17 Nobel lectures.\n          \n          Results. The outcomes of our study indicate that Nobel lectures are extremely powerful expression of prizewinners’ human and professional qualities. We have devised a set of five themes, namely the writer’s social duty, his/her destiny, literary background, tools, and literary outcome to describe the collective image of a writer. Within the framework of our research, literary background falls into two subthemes (literary heritage and a personal writing process); discussing the writer’s toolkit, we focus on language and words.\n          \n          Discussion. Our findings show that laureates develop the concept “writer” to varying degrees but all of them stress a direct interconnection between an active social position and the writer’s destiny. Further research can involve the in-depth study of a definite Nobel lecture in terms of the compositional structure and employed linguistic means",

    "abstract": "This article is about the relationship between reading, trauma and responsive literary caregiving in Britain during the First World War. Its analysis of two little-known documents describing the history of the War Library, begun by Helen Mary Gaskell in 1914, exposes a gap in the scholarship of war-time reading; generates a new narrative of \"how,\" \"when,\" and \"why\" books went to war; and foregrounds gender in its analysis of the historiography. The Library of Congress's T. W. Koch discovered Gaskell's ground-breaking work in 1917 and reported its successes to the American Library Association. The British Times also covered Gaskell's library, yet researchers working on reading during the war have routinely neglected her distinct model and method, skewing the research base on war-time reading and its association with trauma and caregiving. In the article's second half, a literary case study of a popular war novel demonstrates the extent of the \"bitter cry for books.\" The success of Gaskell's intervention is examined alongside H. G. Wells's representation of textual healing. Reading is shown to offer sick, traumatized and recovering combatants emotional and psychological caregiving in ways that she could not always have predicted and that are not visible in the literary/historical record",

She defines 'form' as an arrangement of elements, arguing its concept transcends aesthetics and must be examined alongside philosophical and sociopolitical meanings. Drawing on design theory, literary criticism, and social sciences, Levine analyzes structural patterns in diverse forms, from poems and novels to legal cases and gender norms. Her analysis of Dickens's *Bleak House* exemplifies this approach, showing how literary form actively rewrites sociopolitical forms, emphasizing the specificities of literary texts in understanding social patterns and political structures. This interdisciplinary work advocates for a broader, more engaged formalist analysis."

Kitagawa and Yokomitsu\\u27s engagement with film was not limited to a fascination with the precision, objectivity, or mobility of the “camera eye.” Rather, it extended to the entire ability of the cinematic apparatus to capture the temporality of objects in motion, and of the ability of the filmmaker to organize segments of space into a new synthetic whole. The article explores this confluence through a brief examination of four instances of “cine-text”: Kitagawa\\u27 poetry collection War, Yokomitsu\\u27 novel Shanghai, the concept of literary formalism Yokomitsu proposed around the year 1930, and the theory of the “prose film” that Kitagawa unveiled in the following decade",

The study examines this interplay through four \"cine-text\" instances: Kitagawa's poetry collection War, Yokomitsu's novel Shanghai, Yokomitsu's concept of literary formalism, and Kitagawa's \"prose film\" theory, highlighting how their writings emulated the \"machine eye\" for objective representation.

My findings suggest that the scholarly literary criticism of Things Fall Apart did not occur independently with the publication of Achebe’s work in 1958, but was a part of a larger trend in literary criticism and theory associated with the establishment of postcolonial studies. Moreover, distantly reading the literary criticism of  Things Fall Apart points towards the ways in which critics have narrowly focused on framing Achebe’s text as a work of African culture and colonialism, in comparison with other texts in the genre. This has implications not only for locating Achebe's text within a narrow literary genre but also for the ways in which literary scholars can apply quantitative literary analysis to literary criticism in order to make inferences about the production of literary theory and culture",

This contribution proposes that a combination of functionalistsystemic theories (in casu Itamar Even-Zohar’s Polysystem theory – especially the textually oriented versions – and the prototypical genre approach proposed by Dirk De Geest and Hendrik Van Gorp 1999) with Mikhail Bakhtin’s chronotope theory shows great promise in this respect. Since I am primarily interested in literary genres, the prototypical genre approach assumes a central position in my theoretical framework. My main argument is that Bakhtin’s chronotope concept offers interesting perspectives as a heuristic tool within a functionalist-systemic approach to genre studies, enabling the study not only of the constitutive elements of genre systems, but also of their mutual relations. Bakhtin’s own vague definitions of the concept somewhat hamper the process of putting it into practice for this purpose, but with the aid of the distinction between generic and motivic chronotopes, that problem can be solved. A detailed, comprehensive account of the theoretical premises underlying my proposal can be found in Bemong (under review); here I restrict myself to the basics",

Beyond this similarity to literary works, some video games deploy various design strategies which blend gameplay and literary elements to explicitly foreground a hybrid literary/ludic experience. We identify three such strategies: engaging with literary structures, forms and techniques; deploying text in an aesthetic rather than a functional way; and intertextuality. This paper aims to analyse how these design strategies are deployed in What Remains of Edith Finch (Giant Sparrow, 2017) to support a hybrid readerly/playerly experience. We argue that this type of design is particularly suited for walking simulators because they support interpretive play (Upton, 2015) through slowness, ambiguity (Muscat et al., 2016; Pinchbeck 2012), narrative and aesthetic aspirations (Carbo-Mascarell, 2016).

    "title": "Back to where we came from: evolutionary psychology and children’s literature and media",
    "abstract": "In 2010, The New York Times ran an article which announced that ‘the next big thing in English [Studies]’ was ‘using evolutionary theory to explain fiction’.  This announcement may be considered somewhat belated, given that the interest in the potential relevance of evolutionary psychology  to literary studies might be traced back to a considerably earlier date than 2010.  Joseph Carroll first published on the subject as far back as 1995, and by 2002 Steven Pinker could claim that ‘within the academy, a growing number of mavericks are looking to Evolutionary psychology and cognitive science in an effort to re-establish human nature as the center of any understanding of the arts’.  Nevertheless, The New York Times’s announcement may be taken as a measure of an increasingly visible trend in both popular and academic thinking.  \n\nWe argue in this chapter that this trend is motivated specifically by nostalgia, or the longing for a past which seems forever lost. A second aspect of this nostalgia will also be discussed to do with the way that we argue that this supposedly ‘new’ area of research repeats exactly a long history of prior claims of many eminent children’s literature critics with respect to ideas of childhood, language and children’s literature and media. Despite the repeated, insistent claims of several of the Literary Darwinists, including, for instance, Joseph Carroll, one of the founders of this way of thinking, that they are working in heroic opposition to a dominant, obscurantist and anti-science ‘literary theory’,  we argue here that in fact there is a high degree of convergence between the claims made about childhood, language and children’s literature in Literary Darwinism and much children’s literature criticism. We therefore see Literary Darwinism and (children’s) literature studies as not being in any sense about an opposition or separation between science and literary or humanist studies, but about a convergence underpinned and driven by the same nostalgia for a singular, stable, uniform and universal past, leading to a singular, stable, uniform and universal present.\n\nFinally, we suggest that it is not just in these two fields in which this nostalgia operates, but that this can currently be seen in sub-streams within many disciplines – in both in arts, sciences and humanities -- as a founding, powerfully political, driver",

Despite assertions by proponents like Joseph Carroll of opposing dominant literary theory, the authors find significant convergence between Literary Darwinism's claims about childhood, language, and children's literature and existing children's literature criticism. They conclude that this trend represents a convergence, not an opposition, between science and humanities, fueled by a shared longing for a singular, stable, and universal understanding of the past and present. This nostalgic driver is suggested to operate across many disciplines."

The review highlights how the book complicates the understanding of Chinese literature by connecting various texts through the mother motif, exposing the limitations of the literary canon and gender politics in its formation.

    "title": "The Problem of Temporality in the Literary Framework of Nicholas of Cusa’s De pace fidei",
    "abstract": "This paper explores Nicholas of Cusa’s framing of the De pace fidei as a dialogue taking place incaelo rationis. On the one hand, this framing allows Nicholas of Cusa to argue that all religious rites presuppose the truth of a single, unified faith and so temporally manifest divine logos in a way accommodated to the historically unique conventions of different political communities. On the other hand, at the end of the De pace fidei, the interlocutors in the heavenly dialogue are enjoined to return to earth and lead their countrymen in a gradual conversion to the acceptance of rites which would explicitly acknowledge the metaphysically presupposed transcendent unity of all true faiths. In light of these two aspects of the literary framing of the De pace fidei, the question that motivates this paper concerns the extent to which the understanding of history subtending Cusanus’ temporal political aims is consistent with the understanding of history grounded in his metaphysical presupposition that there is una religio in omni diversitate rituum. In addressing this question, I shall argue that the literary strategy of the De pace fidei sacrifices Nicholas of Cusa’s apologetic doctrinal aims insofar as the text creates an allegorical space in which the tension between its literal and figurative dimensions assigns to its readers the task of choosing their own orientations to the significance of history as a foundation for future action",

    "abstract": "In natural language using short sentences is considered efficient for\ncommunication. However, a text composed exclusively of such sentences looks\ntechnical and reads boring. A text composed of long ones, on the other hand,\ndemands significantly more effort for comprehension. Studying characteristics\nof the sentence length variability (SLV) in a large corpus of world-famous\nliterary texts shows that an appealing and aesthetic optimum appears somewhere\nin between and involves selfsimilar, cascade-like alternation of various\nlengths sentences. A related quantitative observation is that the power spectra\nS(f) of thus characterized SLV universally develop a convincing `1/f^beta'\nscaling with the average exponent beta =~ 1/2, close to what has been\nidentified before in musical compositions or in the brain waves. An\noverwhelming majority of the studied texts simply obeys such fractal attributes\nbut especially spectacular in this respect are hypertext-like, \"stream of\nconsciousness\" novels. In addition, they appear to develop structures\ncharacteristic of irreducibly interwoven sets of fractals called multifractals.\nScaling of S(f) in the present context implies existence of the long-range\ncorrelations in texts and appearance of multifractality indicates that they\ncarry even a nonlinear component.

Unlike her sisters, Soemantri's letters ceased in 1936, reflecting her liberation from traditional constraints and her role, alongside her husband, as a representative of a new Indonesian middle class. The text also touches on themes of gender, ethnicity, and nationalism in relation to the position of Indonesian women, referencing Nira Yuval-Davis's work and Cora Vreede-De Stuers's historical analysis. It explores the interplay between Javanese and colonial reformers, and Muslim and secular nationalists."

    "abstract": "Our understanding of nineteenth-century literary practice is often mediated by the national literature model of study that continues to govern discussions of modern literature. Put differently, contemporary evaluations of literary texts of the nineteenth century are often arrived at by using the national literature models that remain ascendant. This results in particular from the interplay of two concepts, 'nationalism' and 'novelism', and the role that these ideological agendas play in establishing the frameworks for literary study that predominate in today's academy. Novelism is defined by Clifford Siskin as 'the habitual subordination of writing to the novel' —it is the prevalent tendency to approach prose writing in general using a framework of value derived from criticism of the novel.1 Rather than evaluating texts of the period in question by using criteria that can be validly ascribed to the sites of their production, we often tend to employ instead criteria derived from the novel as a currently-ascendant form of writing. Together with the tendency to read literature as defined exclusively by the trajectories offered in national-literature frameworks, this dual agenda has come to represent the most widespread tendency in literary historical scholarship, that of the nationalist-novelist paradigm, which presumes national literatures to be its subject matter, and which evaluates (non-European) prose writing largely through the critical tools developed for assessing the European novel",

Novelism, defined as the subordination of writing to the novel framework, combined with national literature paradigms, creates a nationalist-novelist approach. This paradigm predominantly assesses prose using critical tools developed for the European novel, rather than criteria relevant to the texts' original production contexts.

The discussion focuses on psychologically realistic novels from the 18th and 19th centuries, but also includes other literary forms. It delves into the debate on whether literature offers arguments or opportunities for reflection, and touches upon its potential to function like philosophical or scientific thought experiments, challenging readers to clarify and reflect on existing views. This analysis is crucial for understanding the epistemological value of literary works."

Special attention is given to Matilde Serao’s mediation in the private as well as in the public sphere and to her double role as salon chronicler and salon attendee. Her views with regard to the artistic and political landscape of fin-de-siècle Italy are examined through a series of chronicles on Pasquale Mancini, Baroness Magliani, Francesco De Renzis, and the salon of the literary magazine Capitan Fracassa. The representations of these salons in the fortnightly periodical Cronaca Bizantina (Rome, 1881-1886) as well as in the daily newspaper Corriere di Roma (1883-1886) offered a new reading experience to a wide audience and encouraged the creation of an imagined community of salon attendees. Thus, salon participation is studied through the prism of the periodical press, which interpreted salon life as a meaningful collective experience and a decisive factor in the formation of culture. Serao’s chronicle is also viewed as an instrument of social critique, which raised questions on the rapid expansion of mass media, the growing demand for human progress, the withering away of politics, and the growing importance of art as a means of personal expression",

    "abstract": "Although it is an outstanding example of writing life as negotiation of gender roles as well as exploration of the body as site of identity constructs, Tanja Dückers’s novel Spielzone, published in 1999, has not yet received the critical attention it deserves. The novel displays an interesting aesthetic technique of representing the milieu of two Berlin districts and their inhabitants, whose identity conflicts can be shown to reflect the state of construction of the urban space before its homogenization through gentrification. Especially with regard to gender identities, Dückers portrays the search for a different lifestyle, which is expressed through a striking focus on aesthetic differentiation and cross-dressing. The protagonists stage masculinity and femininity through a theatrical masquerade, which reveals the construct of gender identities and advocates a postmodern transgender existence. The negotiation of a new identity without binary gender attributions ranges from the negation of traditional role assignments to self-mutilation. In the following paper, Dückers’s text will be analysed as uncanny playground of gender between masquerade and brutal gender embodiment, which nevertheless, with all its negations of conventional values, eventually moves near to a return to traditional patterns.peer-reviewe",

    "abstract": "The debate over the canon has gripped the University in recent years. Defenders of the canon argue that canonical texts embody timeless and universal themes, but critics argue that the process of canonization subordinates certain people and viewpoints within society in order to assert the existence of a univocal tradition. Originating primarily in the field of literary criticism, the canon debate recently has emerged in legal theory.\nProfessor Francis J. Mootz argues that the issues raised by the canon debate are relevant to legal scholarship, teaching and practice. After reviewing the extensive commentary on the literary canon, Professor Mootz criticizes the polemical structure of the debate and asserts that an appreciation of classical, as opposed to canonical, texts opens the way for a productive inquiry. He defines a classical text as one that both shapes contemporary concerns and also serves as a point of reference for revising these concerns. Classical texts enable critical perspectives rather than submitting to them, he continues, because they provide the arena for debates about issues of public concern. Using Hadley v. Baxendale as an example of a legal classic, Professor Mootz contends that the power of such a classical text is its ability to shape hotly contested legal debates.\nOur time . . . seems unpropitious for thinking about the question of the classic, for . . . it seems to be a simple either/or that requires merely a choosing of sides: for or against? back to the classics or away from them? Our time calls not for thinking but a vote. And it may well be too late for thinking about the classic in any case, for the vote is already in, and the nays have it",

    "summary": "This paper examines the application of thought experiments within the philosophy of literature, contrasting it with philosophical tendencies towards neat, structured reality. It critiques the idea that reality is inherently chaotic and explores how philosophers, particularly in natural sciences, use experiments to discern deep structures. The author suggests that the preference for order also influences the philosophy of literature, potentially limiting its scope. This analysis delves into the nature of philosophical inquiry, scientific method, and their intersection with literary theory, questioning the perceived clarity and structure in philosophical thought."

A range of twentieth-century theories of paranoia (including clinical, Freudian and Lacanian) have been used as explanatory tools for interpreting the representations of paranoia in the poems. The reading of Tennyson's Maud is based on Freud's theory of homoerotic motives. The reading of Browning's \"'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came'\" is based on the Lacanian concepts of foreclosure and the Name-of-the-Father. The readings of the jealousy poems are based on both theories, and this section includes a discussion of the limitations of the theories as explanatory tools. The general approach has been to apply clinical and psychoanalytical constructs and explanations to each poem separately, although there is some discussion involving the comparison of paranoid behaviours and motives across all the poems.

    "abstract": "This paper is an offshoot of a larger, ongoing project that intends to deal with the relationship between various artistic formations and the dominant culture in Taiwan\\u27s post-1949 era. Though the lifting of martial law in 1987 has demarcated this era into two drastically different periods and a clearer contour of the new period seems to be just beginning to emerge in the mid-1990s, various cultural forces are still busily negotiating with each other. Nonetheless, there seems to be a general consensus as to what constitutes a core of the new dominant culture: the spirit of pen-t\\u27u, or a nativist imperative that obliges one to treat Taiwan as the  center  in one\\u27s cultural mapping. The primary driving force for this recent reconstitution of Taiwan\\u27s dominant culture undoubtedly came from the momentous changes in the political arena in the post-martial law period. This rather crude factor, however, should not obscure our vision of the longer, more far-reaching evolutionary process of cultural change in contemporary Taiwan. Simply put, since the early 1980s, the older cultural hegemony has been seriously contested by forces coming from the Taiwanese cultural nationalism advocated in a vibrant pen-t\\u27u (nativization) trend on the one hand, and from various radical cultural formations on the other. Limited by space, this paper will only deal with specific aspects of the nativization trend, with the main paradigm taken from the literary field. The paper will begin with a brief overview of the indigenous literary discourse in Taiwan’s post-1949 era, followed by analyses of recent scholarly re- evaluations of the Kominka literature from Taiwan’s Japanese period. Through this investigation, I hope to reach a better understanding of some important issues pertaining to contemporary cultural transformation in Taiwan, such as the role of cultural nationalism, the problem of identity construction, and efforts toward institutionalizing Taiwanese literary studies as an academic discipline",

    "abstract": "Throughout the ages, one of the primary mistakes committed in studying the Gospel of John has been to read the text monologically instead of dialogically. This error has often led some readers of the Fourth Gospel to “get it wrong,” needing correction by later interpreters. Put otherwise, many an ecumenical council or more nuanced interpretation has restored the tension that had been lost by interpreters who had sided with one aspect of John’s witness without considering another. Likewise, one flaw of modern literary-critical theories is that they have often sought to ascribe the sources of the Fourth Gospel’s theological tensions to sets of imagined literary poles, failing to consider the possibility that the origin of those tensions was been integral to the thinking and style of the Evangelist. John’s material developed dialogically, and it must be read dialogically if its epistemological origin, developmental character, and rhetorical design are to be adequately understood. Indeed, there are different levels and types of dialogical operation underlying the Johannine text—from origins to receptions—and these involve theological, historical, and literary factors that require a polyvalent approach to Johannine interpretation",

Past interpretations have often failed by taking one-sided views or attributing theological tensions to imagined literary poles, rather than acknowledging them as integral to the Evangelist's style. The author proposes that the Johannine text operates on multiple dialogical levels, encompassing theological, historical, and literary factors. This necessitates a polyvalent approach to interpretation, inviting readers to engage in the ongoing making of meaning, challenging certainties, and embracing the liberating promise found within its narratives."

    "summary": "This review analyzes two books, \"Reading for the Law: British Literary History and Gender Advocacy\" by Christine L. Krueger and \"Law, Literature, and the Transmission of Culture in England, 1837-1925\" by Cathrine O. Frank, within the interdisciplinary field of law and literature. It highlights their contributions to understanding Victorian culture, particularly how imaginative writers engaged with legal developments. Krueger's work explores the efficacy of storytelling for social justice, while Frank's examines ownership, selfhood, and the evolving relationship between law and literature, including insightful readings of inheritance plots and legal developments, though her book could benefit from a narrower focus. Both books offer sophisticated models of the legal-literary nexus and the role of subjectivity in 19th-century legal culture."

    "title": "The Relationship Between Ethics and Literature in Light of Levinas’s Work",
    "abstract": "In my paper I intend to uncover the relationship between ethics and\r\nliterature. The aforementioned issue is connected to ’ethical turn’ —\r\nnew orientation in literary studies, which was introduced in the\r\nnineties of 20th century. In order to uncover its source of inspiration, I\r\nrefer to Lévinas’s works, such as Reality and its Shadow, The poet’s\r\nvision, Totality and Infinity, Otherwise than Being. I advocate the view\r\nthat not only Lévinas’s concept of language, but also his account of\r\npoetry and responsibility underlie ethical criticism. Therefore, they are\r\nregarded as crucial to understand this new approach to literary studies.\r\nTo illustrate my thesis, I attempt to interpret literary works, i.e.\r\nWordsworth’s and Coetzee’s in light of Lévinas’s concepts.Numer został przygotowany przy wsparciu Ministerstwa Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego",

    "summary": "This paper explores the relationship between ethics and literature, specifically examining the 'ethical turn' in literary studies from the 1990s. Drawing inspiration from Emmanuel Lévinas's works, including *Reality and its Shadow*, *The poet's vision*, *Totality and Infinity*, and *Otherwise than Being*, the author argues that Lévinas's concepts of language, poetry, and responsibility are fundamental to ethical criticism. The study analyzes literary works by Wordsworth and Coetzee through Lévinas's framework to illustrate this thesis, highlighting the importance of the reader's responsibility and the ethical significance of narrative form. Key concepts include ethical criticism, Lévinas, poetry, responsibility, and language."

The second anthology, while rich in influential essays from major theorists like Derrida and de Man, is critiqued for not adequately demonstrating how these contributions foster critical self-awareness. Both works collectively highlight the complexity and theoretical richness of contemporary literary discourse, offering valuable texts for students."

    "title": "Former Presidents: Pensions, Office Allowances, and Other Federal Benefits",
    "abstract": "[Excerpt] The Former Presidents Act (FPA; 3 U.S.C. § 102 note) charges the General Services Administration (GSA) with providing former Presidents a pension, support staff, office support, travel funds, and mailing privileges. The FPA was enacted to “maintain the dignity” of the Office of the President by giving a former President — and his or her spouse — certain benefits so that he would not have to enter unsuitable occupations after leaving office. Former Presidents currently receive a pension that is equal to pay for the head of an executive department (Executive Level I), which was $191,300 as of January 1, 2008.\nThe FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $2,478,000 for pensions and GSA assistance to former Presidents. The President’s FY2009 budget requested $2,934,000 for expenditures for former Presidents. Pending House and Senate appropriations legislation recommends the requested amount.\nPrior to 1958, former Presidents leaving office received no pension or federal assistance. After leaving office, some former Presidents — including Ulysses S. Grant and Harry S Truman — struggled financially. In 1912, industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie unveiled a plan to pay $25,000 pensions to all future former Presidents and their widows. The pensions were to be funded by the Carnegie Foundation of New York. Some Members of Congress and the public suggested it was inappropriate for a private company to pay pensions to former Presidents. Legislation was introduced that year to grant public pensions to former Presidents, but none of the bills were reported from committee. William Howard Taft, the only former President who was then eligible for Carnegie’s offer, refused the pension.\nSince 1962, the U.S. Secret Service has provided protection to former Presidents because of their status as “visible national symbol[s].” Protection has subsequently been expanded to cover a former President’s wife until death or remarriage. Minor children of former Presidents who are under 16 years of age also receive protection. In 1994, the law was amended to limit U.S. Secret Service coverage to 10 years for any President, and his spouse, who left office after January 1, 1997. President George W. Bush will be the first former President affected by this statutory change.\nIn the 110th Congress, Representative John Conyers introduced a bill (H.R. 5938) that would extend U.S. Secret Service Protection to a Vice President, his or her spouse, and family for up to six months after leaving office. Currently, Secret Service protection for a Vice President and his or her family is provided on an ad hoc basis.\nThis report describes the benefits Presidents receive upon leaving office, details the history of the FPA, and analyzes some legislative options for the 110th Congress related to former Presidents",
