The questions throughout this booklet reflect some of the ways Boston University School of Management alumni have transformed academic experience into professional results. Curiosity is a positive force, because good management is about exploring, not accepting. It's about revision, refinement, and rethinking rather than regurgitation. It's a matter of taking the heat rather than taking shelter. It's a career of challenging yourself and your employees continually to improve the quality of your products and service. And it's the kind of management you'll learn at Boston University",

The research community has been expending a lot of efforts to come up with a general management paradigm that is able to hide the details of the physical infrastructure and enable flexible network management. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is such a paradigm that simplifies network management and enables network innovations. In this survey paper, by reviewing existing SDN management layers (platforms), we identify the general common management architecture for SDN networks, and further identify the design requirements of the management layer that is at the core of the architecture. We also point out open issues and weaknesses of existing SDN management layers.

It proposes that while consumption-linked pricing improves efficiency, the popular metered tariff faces high transaction costs and farmer resistance, especially for millions of small users. A more feasible alternative is a transformed, rational flat-rate tariff combined with power supply restrictions. The paper highlights the unsustainable legacy of electricity subsidies, leading to overuse of water and energy, threatening power sector viability and groundwater resources, and impacting livelihoods."

Within the knowledge-based economy, SMEs are facing both opportunities and challenges due to the information and communication technologies development. We consider that ICT should be used in small business management within the sector of services because ICT are key tools in management processes and could improve managerial practices. The study is based on evidence provided by articles and research reports. The research question was answered by analysing published sources and interpreting evidence. Another way of approaching this question could be collecting and analysing empirical data from the SMEs within the sector of services and comparing the results with the findings of this study.information and communication technologies, small and medium enterprises, management, services, knowledge-based economy",

    "abstract": "You are not the only company capable to create value for your clients. For making valuable products, for performing high standard services, one company is no longer enough in this new informational era, in this new needs era. Better business performing means now to satisfy more complex needs quicker than ever. Could one company face this challenge alone? Is there another way? Collaboration may be the answer. Maybe the most well-known term when it comes to collaboration between companies is Supply Chain. Why Supply Chain, why Supply Chain Management (SCM)? This article presents the answers to these questions, but also presents different approaches regarding SCM: the logistics approach regarding supply chain management, the strategic approach, the new entrepreneurial approach, supply chain as a win-win game. New paradigms regarding collaboration appeared regarding business collaboration: Adaptive Business Network (ABN). Do these new concepts imply the dead of SCM? Or are them only a new wave in SCM terminology and business orientation? Our conclusion is that these new approach is a normal change in business: businesses are made by people and people don’t like to be conducted (managed). The old-fashioned SCM was based on a coordinator versus several obedients relation. It is absolutely normal to dream at freedom and to be not very efficient while you have to play after somebody else rules. ABN is in the other side of human relations and also business relations – it insists on partnering. Everybody is a part of a chain which has as its main goal customer satisfaction, has the right to make proposals, to negotiate, and to be a winner. Of course, ABN appearance does not involve SCM disappearance, but change in how some chains are managed, in how some chains function. We shall see for the future if an organization with several brains is more successful.Supply Chain Management, Adaptive Business Network, Collaboration",

If access to a destination or attraction is too complicated, time consuming, expensive or not providing adequate capacity, even the most spectacular attraction will remain a secret to most tourists, as they will prefer competitive alternatives” (Smiths, 2003). And to continue this, it is considered that „that cultural differences and uniqueness are important if one wants cultural products to become a commercial success” (Lindenberg, 2004). When cultural tourists are looking to experiment or to improve their knowledge, the question is: “Which are the best strategies and practices to market that experience and knowledge for the cultural tourists” (Kantanen, 2005).

There is little consensus on the optimal management; however, it is agreed that treatment must be prompt to prevent fibrosis and increase oxygenation of penile tissue. It is vital that patient expectations are discussed, a realistic time frame of treatment provided, and treatment started as close to the prostatectomy as possible. Current treatment regimens rely on phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors as a first-line therapy, with vacuum erection devices and intraurethral suppositories of alprostadil as possible treatment combination options. With nonresponders to these therapies, intracavernosal injections are resorted to. As a final measure, patients undergo the highly invasive penile prosthesis implantation. There is no uniform, objective treatment program for erectile dysfunction post-radical prostatectomy. Management plans are based on poorly conducted and often underpowered studies in combination with physician and patient preferences.

Four international standards recognized world- wide were selected for comparison: PMI, PRINCE2, IPMA, ISO 31000 and IEC 62198. Project management has evolved over recent years into a mature professional discipline characterized by a formalized body of knowledge and the definition of systematic processes for the execution of a project. All these and possibly other factors as well, have resulted in growing numbers of books, articles and conferences being devoted to project risk management. This level of activity has also led to the development of a number of standards that prescribe for and advise organizations on the best way to manage their risks. Every meaningful standard for project management contains project risk management as its important part.Web of Science4613",

    "abstract": "Report of a CELT project on supporting students through innovation and researchInformation technologies have played a leading role in supporting many recent changes in teaching and learning approaches in Higher Education. Contemporary innovation finds information technology (IT) at the heart of Higher Education transformation. The opportunities afforded by these learning technologies are well documented in popular academic literature. They point to new applications of the latest communication technologies. However, they also bring with them a host of new questions and challenges. The management of e-learners is likely to be part of a more far-reaching organisational change. Where learning technologies are introduced, a layer of technical complexity is added. The redesign of business processes and structures is far from simple ‘technical’ matter. It involves significant social redesign. The extent to which enabling technology has driven the shift towards learner-centred learning in all educational contexts is a matter of debate. As the century turns, establishing the acceptance, let alone the effectiveness and quality of technology-mediated learning, is still seriously problematic (Salmon, 1999). However, the suitability of information and communication technology (ICT) as a means of encouraging self-directed learning is not in doubt, nor that the role of the tutor is changing to ‘guide on the side’: a facilitator not transmitter, of information (Marchmont, 2000). This paper reports findings of a single case study at Wolverhampton Business School. Qualitative data was collected through structured and unstructured interviews with learners and tutors on Business Administration Award. A total of 20 learners and 5 tutors form the basis of the findings",

Here, we review water management practices in five Texas cities and\r\nexamine how the One Water approach could represent a viable framework to maintain a\r\nreliable, sustainable, and affordable water supply for the future. We also examine financial and\r\nbusiness models that establish a foundational pathway towards the ‘utility of the future’ and\r\nthe One Water paradigm more broadly",

Historically, the valley, spanning parts of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, transitioned from Tsarist-era diverse crops to Soviet-era centralized cotton and grain production with extensive irrigation. Post-Soviet changes led to increased farmers and diverse crops, causing unreliable and inequitable water distribution. Interventions focused on empowering water users associations (WUAs) through training and technical support, leading to improved water conservation, better infrastructure, and enhanced farmer-agency interactions, ultimately boosting agricultural productivity and reducing disputes."

    "abstract": "While much attention has been focused on the optimal ratio of a firm's debt to equity, the \"optimal\" or best balance between bond financing and (longer-term) bank financing has scarcely been addressed. This essay examines the principal differences between an economy with a well-developed corporate bond market free from government interference and an economy in which bank financing plays a central role (as in East Asia). When a full-fledged corporate bond market is present, market forces have a much greater opportunity to assert themselves, thereby reducing systemic risk and the probability of a crisis. This is because such an environment is associated with greater accounting transparency, a large community of financial analysts, respected rating agencies, a wide range of corporate debt securities and derivatives demanding sophisticated credit analysis, and efficient procedures for corporate reorganization and liquidation. In addition, the richness of available securities will tend to enhance economic welfare, and the market forces at work on the wide array of bond prices are likely to have a strong spillover effect on the health of the banking system as well",

It argues that a robust corporate bond market, free from government interference, fosters greater accounting transparency, sophisticated credit analysis, and efficient reorganization procedures. This environment reduces systemic risk, enhances economic welfare, and positively impacts the banking system. The study highlights the role of market forces, financial analysts, and rating agencies in promoting stability and avoiding financial crises, contrasting it with economies where bank financing is central. Key concepts include debt-to-equity ratio, bond financing, bank financing, systemic risk, financial crisis, corporate bond market, accounting transparency, financial analysts, credit analysis, and economic welfare."

The research finds that gender, SAT scores, GPA, and concentration significantly impact student performance. Interestingly, student perceptions of teaching and knowledge gained do not correlate with ETS scores. However, students who feel challenged in their finance course perform significantly better on the exam. This finding highlights the importance of challenging coursework in finance education outcomes."

The author argues that these assumptions are often violated, especially for options or dynamic strategies, and that investors exhibit skewness preference. The study considers a market where the market portfolio has i.i.d. returns, leading to its mean-variance inefficiency and mismeasurement by CAPM alpha. The research explores alternative criteria like \"Value at Risk\" and the \"Sortino Ratio,\" focusing on how these measures perform under lognormal market and portfolio return assumptions, contrasting them with CAPM beta."

It highlights that 74% of rejected transactions are from SMEs and midcap firms, and female-owned businesses face higher rejection rates and limited alternatives.

    "abstract": "Woman-owned firms engage differently with finance for trade. The barriers they face in starting and running a business are well-known. Yet, this offers little insight into how they finance their business once globalized. Surveys indicate that finance is often the primary barrier to trade. We seek to deepen and modernize this finding by using a unique data set to explore the patterns of financial access exhibited by woman-owned exporting firms. We show that women face two levels of exclusion in access to finance—access to basic finance and access to trade finance. The latter is driven by characteristics common to firms owned by women. Also, in line with existing work, we show that woman-owned firms tend to turn to informal finance as an alternative more than their male counterparts. However, we also show that women are more likely to adopt fintech as a financial solution than men. This suggests that policies aimed at incentivizing banks to lend more to women may not be solving the right problem",

We introduce these coupled two-country KWG dynamics on the extensive form level by means of a subdivision into nine modules describing the behavioral equations, the laws of motion and the identities or budget equations of the model. We then derive their intensive form representation and the 10 laws of motion of the model on the basis of certain simplifying assumptions. Thereafter we present the uniquely determined steady state solution of the dynamics and discuss in a mathematically informal way its stability properties, concerning asymptotic stability and loss of stability by way of super- or subcritical Hopf-bifurcations. In a final section we explore numerically a variety of situations of interacting real and financial cycles, where the steady state is locally repelling, but where the overall dynamics are bounded in an economically meaningful domain by means of a kinked money wage Phillips curve, exhibiting downward rigidity of the money-wage, coupled with upward flexibility of the usual type.Interacting KWG economies, stability, persistent cycles, coupled oscillators.",

We answer this question in an examination of CSP ratings of more than 2,600 companies from 36 countries. We find that firm characteristics explain very little of the variations in CSP ratings. In contrast, variations in country factors such as stages of economic development, culture, and institutions account for a significant proportion of variations in CSP ratings across countries. In particular, we find that CSP ratings are high in countries with high income-per-capita, strong civil liberties and political rights, and cultures oriented toward harmony and autonomy.

    "abstract": "The busrt of the bubble has given momentum to the search of escape routes from the current transnational financial system and its underlying principles. For the past century, The transnational financial system has relied heavily on currency exchange, security backed loans, stocks and shares - all operated through banks, investment agencies, insurance brokers and stock markets. This global financial architecture centred on monetray values. It strived for financial wealth and achieved it for few out of many. This study shows that the practice of finance can create a wealth of a different - a scoial- nature. Applying an ethnographic approach to financial practices, this study tries to uncover how the sociocultural aspects of finance practiced among the poor rural women in Sri Lanka lead to the creation of social wealth beyond financial wealth. It discovers how finance is critical to such communities becauise it is creating wealth beyond financial measurement. Finance comes to Sinalhese women's everyday lives through traditional savings systems - seettu, household and group saving and it operates through frienships, kin relationships and social realtions. These community organisation develop social wealth through their thrifts, based on traditional practices of saving.Since transnational finance is driven by monetary values only, it overlays structures and that ignores local cultures, social networks and community identies necessary for the creation of social wealth. As a consequence, encounters with transnational finance inspire resistance in citizens of developing nations such as Sri Lanka. In an attempt to preserve their more tradional ways of exchange, communities find themselves workign agianst finance. Therefore in this paper I am interested in engaging in a dialogue with a rural community, to learn their ways of organising finance and the extent to which finance becomes critical to their everyday live",

It critiques the transnational financial system's focus on monetary values, which often disregards local cultures and social networks. Through an ethnographic approach, the research explores how traditional savings systems like 'seettu,' integrated with friendships and kin relationships, contribute to community well-being. The findings suggest that these localized financial practices create social capital and inspire resistance to transnational financial structures, demonstrating finance's critical role in fostering social wealth for developing nations."

It highlights the chaotic state of economists' views on fiscal policy in the early 2000s, where mainstream academic macroeconomists widely discredited short-run discretionary fiscal policy. The authors argue that the abandonment of Keynesian theories has left policymakers without clear guidance, allowing political interests to dominate budgeting. The discussion touches upon the Stability and Growth Pact in the EU and state government deficits in the US, emphasizing the need for integrating sound finance with functional finance principles."

    "title": "Seeking Rights, Not Rent: How Litigation Finance Can Help Break Music Copyright\\u27s Precedent Gridlock",
    "abstract": "Since its inception, litigation finance has steadily grown in prevalence and popularity in the United States.  While many scholars have examined its merits, few have considered litigation finance specifically in the context of copyright law.  This is most unfortunate, for there, a vicious cycle has taken hold: high litigation costs discourage many market participants from taking cases to trial or summary judgment in order to vindicate their legal rights, even when they have strong cases. Thus, parties settle almost every case, which in turn prevents resolution of longstanding precedential questions in critical areas of copyright law.  The legal uncertainty resulting from this precedential gridlock generates higher avoidance costs and poses more financial risks for market participants, particularly less-heeled or less-established parties.       This Note proposes one way in which litigation finance could help break that cycle.  Specifically, rights holders and defendants alike can use litigation finance to fund strategic-litigation campaigns to pressure the development of precedent.  To illustrate how this might work, this Note examines litigation finance in the narrow context of music copyright, an area that perfectly illustrates the problems besetting copyright law writ large.  In doing so, this Note flips a popular criticism of litigation finance on its head: while some scholars argue that litigation finance can distort litigation strategy by encouraging litigants to reject mutually beneficial settlements, it is normatively desirable to do so given the unsettled state of music copyright law",

High litigation costs lead to settlements, preventing the resolution of critical precedential questions and increasing legal uncertainty and financial risks for market participants.

This approach reframes the criticism that litigation finance distorts strategy by encouraging rejections of settlements, arguing it is desirable given the unsettled state of music copyright law.

    "abstract": "The financial crisis, which began to hit the trade finance markets in 2008, caused a sharp slow-down in trade in 2008 and 2009. The tightening of global credit reduced capital inflows and curtailed the availability of trade finance. This sudden shortage of trade finance negatively impacted African economies. In response, the African Development Bank (AfDB) established, on March 2009, a multiphase USD 1 billion Trade Finance Initiative (TFI). As part of the Trade Finance Initiative, AfDB commissioned a trade finance survey conducted three times between 2009 and 2010. The financial institutions contacted during these market surveys are listed at the end of this document. During this research, banks in Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Rwanda were contacted. In addition, financial institutions active in the international and regional trade finance markets based in the USA, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands were contacted. Finally, development finance institutions active in supporting trade both within Africa and without were interviewed. Generally trade operations officers, international department management, treasury officers or senior commercial bankers were contacted. Participants were asked to: • Describe their trade finance related activities • Describe the state of the market for trade finance products • Describe how availability of facilities has changed •Describe how terms and conditions of facilities have changed •Discuss overall economic activity in their markets • Discuss potential roles for AfDB to play to facilitate access to trade finance The overall conclusions of these surveys are: • African trade grew rapidly during the pre-crisis period, spurred by growing south-south trade and the emergence of Asia as a major purchaser of African raw materials and primary products. Anecdotally, it appears that trade finance was increasingly available during this period. • The crisis has had a negative impact on African trade due to falling demand for African primary product exports. Trade finance availability was sharply constrained during the initial crisis period. • It is difficult to discern real trends in African trade finance as markets remain highly volatile. Liquidity and risk appetite vary widely across markets and counterparties. Across all markets, trade finance tenors have shortened. • There is an overall decrease in demand for trade products due to decreased economic activity but a higher proportion of the current transactions are using trade instruments. • International commercial banks that historically provided confirmation lines for trade instruments remain risk averse and seek to maintain/increase returns. • Low income countries and the smaller Regional Member Countries are hit hardest by the lack of availability of trade finance due to higher perceived risk, even for low risk transactions. • Basel II related capital allocation rules will have a negative impact on the cost and availability of trade finance across the continent. • Multilateral Development Banks in other regions play a variety of roles to support trade finance availability, from which AfDB could learn some lessons. • The African Development Bank can have a significant impact on trade finance availability and, consequently, RMC economic performance over the short/medium term.",

Key findings indicate rapid pre-crisis growth spurred by south-south trade, a sharp post-crisis constraint in trade finance availability, and ongoing market volatility. The report also highlights decreased demand for trade products, risk aversion among international commercial banks, and the disproportionate impact on low-income countries.

    "title": "The private finance initiative (PFI) and finance capital: A note on gaps in the \"accountability\" debate",
    "abstract": "During recent years, a wide spectrum of research has questioned whether public services/infrastructure procurement through private finance, as exemplified by the UK Private Finance Initiative (PFI), meets minimum standard of democratic accountability. While broadly agreeing with some of these arguments, this paper suggests that this debate is flawed on two grounds. Firstly, PFI is not about effective procurement, or even about a pragmatic choice of procurement mechanisms which can potentially compromise public involvement and input; rather it is about a process where the state creates new profit opportunities at a time when the international financial system is increasingly lacking in safe investment opportunities. Secondly, because of its primary function as investment opportunity, PFI, by its very nature, prioritises the risk-return criteria of private finance over the needs of the public sector client and its stakeholders. Using two case studies of recent PFI projects, the paper illustrates some of the mechanisms through which finance capital exercises control over the PFI procurement process. The paper concludes that recent proposals aimed at “reforming” or “democratising” PFI fail to recognise the objective constraints which this type of state-finance capital nexus imposes on political process",

The research aims to clarify the debate surrounding the IMF's role in catalyzing lending to developing countries, where official assistance is theorized to strategically complement private sector funding. Key concepts include catalytic finance, debtor adjustment, moral hazard, and sovereign debt. This model helps to understand the conditions under which official assistance can galvanize private creditors to mitigate funding crises for debtor countries, contributing to discussions on international finance and economic policy."

It then outlines 10 challenges for Operational Research to support modelling in consumer finance. Some of these involve developing more robust risk assessment systems, whereas others are to expand the use of such modelling to deal with the current objectives of lenders and the new decisions they have to make in consumer finance. <br/",

While CSG has made up a small part of Australia’s gas supply mix since the late 90s, production has increased drastically in the past few years, and with it the threat of many more CSG projects going ahead in the near future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the end of 2013, Queensland was home to approximately 5,500 CSG producing wells, however this number is projected to grow to over 14,000 by the end of 2020. Similarly, NSW CSG production is expected to increase dramatically if two major proposed projects go ahead. AGL’s Gloucester gas project is expected to produce up to 30 petajoules (PJ) per annum over its 30-year lifespan, and Santos’ Narrabri project up to 73PJ per annum over 25 years. Together, these two NSW projects’ annual production would amount to around 40% of the total CSG produced in Queensland during the 2013-14 financial year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe massive increase in CSG production is largely due to the development of three liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities on Curtis Island in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area near Gladstone, Queensland, which are to be supplied with gas from unconventional sources in eastern Australia",

    "title": "Monitoring Climate Finance in Developing Countries: Challenges and Next Steps",
    "abstract": "At the 18th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the parties agreed to a standard format for developed countries to follow when reporting on the climate finance they provide to developing countries. Developed countries will use these formats for the first time when they submit their Biennial Reports to the UNFCCC in early 2014. Later in 2014, developing countries are expected to submit Biennial Update Reports showing the financial support that they have received. From initial attempts to measure and report climate finance by developed and developing countries, it is already apparent that information on finance provided is unlikely to match information on finance received.Aside from the reporting requirements of the UNFCCC, better financial data can help decision makers in developing countries identify gaps, improve coordination and management, and raise funds to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Better climate finance information can also enable countries to draw lessons from the use of different financial instruments and develop strategies and policies that aim to expand finance for climate change. Improved data will allow the information reported by developed countries to be cross-checked, thus promoting transparency, completeness, and accuracy. Finally, it can contribute to a more comprehensive picture of climate financial flows in relation to development assistance at the national and international levels. This working paper reports on three workshops in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in which participants discussed some of the steps that developing countries and their international partners can take toward monitoring and tracking climate finance more effectively. More than 40 representatives from 20 developing countries, regional development banks, and national organizations attended the three workshops. Participants shared information on the limits of existing legislation and mandates, national planning and approval processes, financial management systems, efforts to coordinate among ministries and development partners, and many other unique challenges faced by the participating countries. WRI obtained additional information via a questionnaire, follow-up correspondence, and interviews with representatives of the countries",

    "abstract": "Islamic financial institutions have been growing rapidly in the past few years. Islamic finance refers to investments that are permissible in accordance with Sharia, the Islamic law. Sharia law views money as a measuring tool for value and not an “asset” itself. “It does not permit receipt and payment of riba(interest), gharar(excessive uncertainty), maysir(gambling), short sales or financing activities that it considers harmful to society” (IMF website). Interest, a form of income from money, is therefore prohibited. For example, the income obtained from banks must come from the gain or loss of the enterprises they underwrite and not from interest obtained from loans granted. Sharia-compliant finance is thus often viewed as a unique form of socially responsible investment. Islamic finance exists to further the socio-economic goals of Islam. The question is: How can Islamic finance contribute to economic development? This essay explores its contribution to economic development through microfinance and the use of sukuk(Islamic bond). It will also explore the main opportunities and challenges for Islamic finance today. In order to facilitate the following reading, all Islamic terms used in this essay will be defined in the glossary (Appendix I)",

Housing, being a significant long-term purchase, necessitates robust financing systems. The study finds that stronger legal rights for borrowers and lenders (via collateral and bankruptcy laws), deeper credit information systems, and a stable macroeconomic environment significantly contribute to deeper housing finance systems globally and within emerging market economies.

    "abstract": "This repository item contains a policy brief from the Boston University Global Economic Governance Initiative. The Global Economic Governance Initiative (GEGI) is a research program of the Center for Finance, Law & Policy, the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, and the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. It was founded in 2008 to advance policy-relevant knowledge about governance for financial stability, human development, and the environment.China is one of the largest creditors of Latin American and the Caribbean and has loaned the region more than $125 billion since 2005. However, the composition of China’s financing in the region has been concentrated in commodity related sectors that are currently on the decline. This policy brief notes the extent to which Chinese finance is concentrated in new green economy sectors, and finds that China is not taking full opportunity of the potential in this sector. Moreover, as the global commodity boom has declined, much of China’s investments in the region have been exposed to significant risk, including prominent environmental and social risks. Despite great strides whereby the Chinese government has established a series of guidelines on greening overseas investment over the last few years, China’s development banks and companies are lacking the policies and staffing to identify and fully mitigate such risks. This policy brief reviews the green profile of Chinese development finance in LAC and analyzes environment related risks and policies for Chinese overseas investment. It also outlines the opportunities of green finance in LAC and how blending instruments can mobilize green financial flows that are beneficial for both China and LAC",

We define antiquity as the length of established statehood (i.e., state history) and agricultural years. We argue that extractive institutions and deeply entrenched interest groups may prevail in societies with ancient roots. The paper offers an in-depth analysis of one particular channel through which extractive institutions may impair economic growth: the finance-growth channel. We propose that in countries with ancient statehood, the financial sector might be captured by powerful economic and political elites leading to a distorted finance-growth relationship. We build a model in which the equilibrium relationship between companies and banks depends on the entrenchment of the economic elites and the length of established statehood. To validate our argument empirically, we run panel-threshold regressions on a global sample between 1970 and 2014. The regression results are supportive and show that financial development – measured by the outstanding amount of credit – is negative for growth in states with ancient institutional origins, while it is positive in relatively younger ones",

It clarifies that disinflation, a slower rate of price increase, differs from deflation, which is an ongoing decrease in the aggregate price level. The author argues that current evidence, such as changes in relative prices or declines in the Producer Price Index, does not necessarily indicate economy-wide deflation. Projections from the Congressional Budget Office and private-sector forecasters anticipate modest upward drift in Consumer Price Index and GDP price indexes, not deflation. The study concludes that while brief periods of deflation are possible in a low-inflation environment, they are unlikely to be sustained.

I argue, using evidence and theory, that corporate finance is a key factor behind this evolution. Inside the finance industry, credit intermediation and corporate finance are more important than globalization, increased trading, or the development of mutual funds for explaining the trend. In the non financial sector, firms with low cash flows account for a growing share of total investment. I build a simple equilibrium model to capture these salient features and I use it to interpret the data. I find that corporate demand is the main contributor to the growth of the finance industry, but also that efficiency gains in finance have been important to limit credit rationing.

The study finds that explaining observed output dispersion necessitates a higher capital share or lower elasticity of substitution between capital and labor than typically assumed. Crucially, the impact of technological parameter changes on output is markedly greater when financial frictions are present, emphasizing that finance matters. Keywords: financial intermediation, economic development, contract enforcement, capital share, elasticity of substitution, financial frictions."

It highlights maintained plant and equipment expenditures, curtailed inventory purchasing, and smaller corporate income tax payments compared to 1956. Profits and depreciation allowances provided a larger share of funds, alongside record-level capital market borrowing. Bank borrowing moderated, and corporate liquid asset balance reductions were smaller. The paper also discusses the narrow spread between stock and bond yields, influencing investment flow into the corporate bond market, and changes in yield spreads throughout the period."

    "abstract": "The transition to markets dominates the development agenda of the 1990s. Financial sector reforms are central to a successful transition to a market economy. The author focuses on one dimension of these reforms: the development of housing finance institutions and services. He presents a progress report for the years since 1989, when the road to change opened with the collapse of communist regimes in most countries. Rather than a detailed account of reform in 25 countries, he offers a general framework for analyzing change and evaluating the prospects for rapid development of market-based housing finance systems. To understand why sound housing finance systems have not yet developed, one must consider factors in four key reform areas: the macroeconomic policies adopted to liberalize the economy and stabilize prices; privatization policies, in particular in housing and real estate; the strategies adopted - whether by design or by default - to reform the financial sector; the nature of the financial priorities and institutional constraints affecting housing finance reform strategies followed in different countries. Housing finance policy development has been somewhat haphazard in many countries. But the evidence suggests that the transition economiesthat have achieved low inflation, have adopted radical banking reforms, and seriously reformed and liberalized their real estate sector should be among the first to develop a modern system of housing finance.Non Bank Financial Institutions,Banks&Banking Reform,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Housing Finance,Public Sector Economics&Finance,Banks&Banking Reform,Housing Finance,Public Sector Economics&Finance,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Municipal Financial Management",

    "abstract": "We examine financial constraints and forms of finance used for investment, by analysing survey data on 157 large privatised companies in Hungary and Poland for the period 1998 – 2000. The Bayesian analysis using Gibbs sampling is carried out to obtain inferences about the sample companies’ access to finance from a model for categorical outcome. By applying alternative measures of financial constraints we find that foreign companies, companies that are part of domestic industrial groups and enterprises with concentrated ownership are all less constrained in their access to finance. Moreover, we identify alternative modes of finance since different corporate control and past performance characteristics influence the sample firms’ choice of finance source. In particular, while being industry-specific, the access to domestic credit is positively associated with company size and past profitability. Industrial group members tend to favour bond issues as well as sells-offs of assets as appropriate types of finance for their investment programmes. Preferences for raising finance in the form of equity are associated with share concentration in a non-monotonic way, being most prevalent in those companies where the dominant owner holds 25%-49% of shares. Close links with a leading bank not only increase the possibility of bond issues but also appear to facilitate access to non-banking sources of funds, in particular, to finance supplied by industrial partners. Finally, reliance on state finance is less likely for the companies whose profiles resemble the case of unconstrained finance, namely, for companies with foreign partners, companies that are part of domestic industrial groups and companies with a strategic investor. Model implications also include that the use of state funds is less likely for Polish than for Hungarian companies.financial constraints, investment, enterprises, foreign ownership, industrial groups, concentrated ownership, leading bank, proportional-odds model, Bayesian updating.",

    "abstract": "The crisis of 2007-9 resulted from a financial bubble marked by weak production, expanding bank assets, and growing household indebtedness. For these reasons the crisis casts light on the financialisation of capitalist economies. The literature on financialisation generally links weak production with booming finance; according to some, causation runs from weak production to booming finance, while for others it runs in the opposite direction. This article argues that there is no direct causation between booming finance and weak production. Rather, financialisation represents systemic transformation of capitalist production and finance, which ultimately accounts for the crisis of 2007-9, and has three main features. First, less reliance of large corporations on banks; second, banks shifting their activities toward mediating in open markets and transacting with individuals; third, increasing implication of individuals in the operations of finance.",

Whereas South Africa’s financial institutions largely managed to strengthen their capital positions during the global financial crisis, the country’s trade flows and access to capital (in particular trade finance and its costs) were hit hard by the crisis. Little is known about the extent of shortages or ‘gaps’ in trade finance and the impact of this on South Africa’s recent trade performance.

The paper also discusses what lessons emerging market countries and transition countries can draw from the experience of advanced OECD countries. The OECD experience clearly indicates that-regardless of whether the debt management office is located inside or outside the Ministry of Finance-four issues are of vital importance: 1) Giving priority to strategic public policy objectives rather than tactical trading objectives. 2) Strengthening the institutional capacity to deal with financial portfolio management and with the public policy aspects of debt management. 3) Modernizing debt management. 4) Creating mechanisms to ensure successful delegation and accountability to the Ministry of Finance and Parliament.Public Sector Economics&Finance,Public&Municipal Finance,Strategic Debt Management,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Urban Economics,Public Sector Economics&Finance,Strategic Debt Management,Urban Economics,Public&Municipal Finance,Banks&Banking Reform",

    "summary": "This paper analyzes institutional arrangements for public debt management, drawing lessons from OECD countries' experiences in the late 1980s and 1990s. It focuses on principal-agent issues arising from delegating authority from the Minister of Finance to debt management offices and examines governance structures and control mechanisms. The study identifies four critical issues: prioritizing strategic public policy over tactical trading objectives, strengthening institutional capacity for financial portfolio and public policy aspects of debt management, modernizing debt management, and establishing mechanisms for accountability. These findings offer valuable insights for emerging market and transition economies regarding public debt and financial management."

    "abstract": "A well-organized and effective finance ministry and its associated central finance agencies (CFAs) are essential to good fiscal outcomes. Recent studies of CFAs in selected low-income countries demonstrate that their organizational structure varies widely and that decision making on public finance is strongly influenced by political economy factors. This note presents some common themes arising from the case studies and provides some descriptive evidence about the organizational structure of the CFAs. This note also includes evidence of a “U-curve” pattern in the development of the organizational structure of CFAs over the long term. It confirms that political economy analysis, though difficult to apply in practice, is highly relevant in the development of reform strategies for strengthening CFAs and public financial management systems.finance ministry, central finance agencies, fiscal, public finance, political economy, low-income countries, development, reform, public financial management, World Bank",

The author attributes excessive money supply, leading to a decay in purchasing power, mainly to the fiscal-monetary policies of the United States. Specifically, American government fiscal deficits generated Treasury debt, which was then absorbed by central banks, increasing the global money supply. The Bretton Woods system linked monetary systems, making smaller economies subservient to American policies, propagating inflation globally and fostering a form of seignorage."

    "abstract": "Despite the growing resonance of events within the marketing domain, they continue to receive scant coverage in academic literature, and remain a poor relation to other forms of marketing communication. This detracts from them realising their potential as a relevant and pervasive marketing delivery method.\n\nCouched between the authors previous and future (ongoing) empirical work in this area, this article provides much needed conceptual development.  The paper introduces the core construct of ‘marketing space’ and associated framework.  Marketing space represents the distinctive environment a marketing event creates, which is unlike that cultivated by other communication methods.  Marketing space is a transient reality where representatives of an organisation come together physically, and in a planned manner, with a gathering of existing and future customer’s, clients, and wider stakeholders.\n\nMarketing events are a grouping that comprises a wide and rich variety of event types, which can be termed ‘marketing event platforms’.  These range from the largest of congresses or trade shows, to the smallest and most intimate of seminars or hospitality events.  The conceptual framework of marketing space, with associated concepts provides the basis of a new lexicon for practitioners and academics interested in, and utilising, events for marketing purpose.\n\nThe paper also explores the rationale for the growing resonance of marketing events; examining the characteristics of events, including experiential, interactive, targeted, and relational.  The paper ends with the introduction of two dichotomies to the lexicon of marketing events’ direct and indirect events, and exclusive and non exclusive events",

It identifies two critical factors for determining direct marketing potential: the existing infrastructure and emerging environmental changes. The authors note the substantial resource requirements for direct marketing but propose cooperative international direct marketing as an effective alternative for exporters. This approach allows businesses to combine resources, thereby simplifying the process of establishing a market presence and increasing exports. Key concepts include direct marketing, international trade, and cooperative strategies."

These factors are the overall structure of the campaign, the characteristics of the product or service, the content of the message, the characteristics of the diffusion and, the peer-to-peer information conduit. The paper discusses three examples of viral marketing campaigns and identifies the specific factors in each case that influence its success.

A theoretical framework for the study of R&D - marketing integration levels developed by Gupta et al (1986) is one of the most widely cited R&D - marketing integration frameworks in scientific literature. It is based on the presumption that strategy, environmental, organizational and individual factors are those determining R&D - marketing integration levels and consequently NPD success. Several empirical studies have been conducted to test this framework, however most of them have dealt only with portions of Gupta et al (1986)'s model. This paper is an attempt to put forward and test an integrated research protocol for the study of R&D - marketing integration, based on this theoretical framework. Empirical evidence gained from a questionnaire survey and two company case studies show, that people active within the R&D - marketing interface perceive the studied constructs as relevant for R&D - marketing integration, thus giving confirmation to Gupta et al (1986)’s model. The presented research protocol can therefore be considered as a valid start into R&D - marketing integration research within an integrated framework",

    "abstract": "The need to endow marketing graduates with skills relevant to employability grows ever more important. Marketing math and elementary financial understanding are essential employability skills, particularly given the contemporary emphasis on marketing metrics, but the evidence is that marketing graduates are often relatively weak in such skills. This article suggests that one educational strategy to improve numeracy and financial skills may be through the use of a marketing simulation game. Through the simulation game, students are exposed to marketing calculations and financial data in an engaging context that simulates the real world. It is hypothesized that marketing students’ numeracy and financial skills, and their self-efficacy with respect to marketing calculations, will improve following participation in a simulation game where numerical and financial analysis are necessary activities. Using a quasi-experimental research design, it is found that there are substantial and significant improvements in numerical and financial performance after participating in a simulation game, but that there is no improvement (and possibly a small decline) in self-efficacy related to these tasks. Marketing educators are advised that a marketing simulation game is a viable option to consider when seeking to improve students’ numeracy and financial skillsPeer reviewe",

The research addresses the women‟s reasons for moving from corporate marketing careers to self-employment in marketing and discovers that their career anchor is their embeddedness in the marketing profession which remains a constant throughout their career. This suggests that marketing talent is being lost to the corporate environment but not necessarily to the profession.

Changes resulting from the publishing process, such as peer review, editing, corrections, structural formatting, and other quality control mechanisms may not be reflected in this document. Changes may have been made to this work since it was submitted for publication. Copyright @ 2013 Elsevier B.V.Industrial marketing planning is a typical example of an unstructured decision making problem due to the large number of variables to consider and the uncertainty imposed on those variables. Although abundant studies identified barriers and facilitators of effective industrial marketing planning in practice, the literature still lacks practical tools and methods that marketing managers can use for the task. This paper applies fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) to industrial marketing planning. In particular, agent based inference method is proposed to overcome dynamic relationships, time lags, and reusability issues of FCM evaluation. MACOM simulator also is developed to help marketing managers conduct what-if scenarios to see the impacts of possible changes on the variables defined in an FCM that represents industrial marketing planning problem. The simulator is applied to an industrial marketing planning problem for a global software service company in South Korea. This study has practical implication as it supports marketing managers for industrial marketing planning that has large number of variables and their cause–effect relationships. It also contributes to FCM theory by providing an agent based method for the inference of FCM. Finally, MACOM also provides academics in the industrial marketing management discipline with a tool for developing and pre-verifying a conceptual model based on qualitative knowledge of marketing practitioners.Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Korea",

Whilst there has been an abundance of global media attention on sporting events such as the Olympics and World Football Cup, there seems to be a lack of integration between the sports marketing and international business disciplines both from a practical and also academic standpoint. This paper aims to discuss international sport marketing and why it is an important attribute of business-to-business marketing. Design/methodology/approach &ndash; The aim of the paper is to provide practical implications and research avenues for those seeking to further investigate international sport marketing as a unique area of academic research. The introduction to the paper focuses on the importance of sport to the global economy and how entrepreneurship is ingrained in many sport businesses and organizations. Next, different areas of international business management that relate to entrepreneurial sport marketing ventures are discussed in terms of future research directions and practical implications. These include how entrepreneurial sport ventures affect internationalization, branding, corporate social responsibility, tourism, regional development, marketing and action sports.Findings &ndash; The paper concludes by finding that there are numerous research avenues for future research on international sport marketing that combine different areas of marketing together with the sport marketing and international business literature. In addition, there is enormous potential for linking the sports marketing and international business literature through focusing on entrepreneurial sport ventures that occur worldwide.Research limitations/implications &ndash; The authors demonstrate the need to take an international perspective of sports marketing and business-to-business relationships.Practical implications &ndash; The paper discusses how and why sport firms interact in the international marketplace and how future competition will benefit from more sport-based business-to-business partnerships.Originality/value &ndash; The paper examines the important area of international sports marketing and how businesses that are both profit and non-profit orientated collaborate.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the notable absence of integration between sports marketing and international business disciplines, aiming to highlight international sport marketing as a crucial aspect of business-to-business marketing. It adopts a conceptual approach, reviewing existing literature to identify practical implications and future research avenues. The discussion emphasizes the global economic importance of sport and the ingrained entrepreneurship within sport organizations, linking entrepreneurial sport ventures to internationalization, branding, corporate social responsibility, tourism, regional development, marketing, and action sports. The findings reveal extensive research potential in combining marketing areas with sport marketing and international business literature, particularly through entrepreneurial sport ventures worldwide."

    "abstract": "There appear to be some problems in defining direct marketing. Bauer and Miglautsch (1992) present direct marketing as a relational marketing process. According to Schofield (1995: 36), \"Such a definition excludes much marketing work which employs individual direct marketing techniques on a pragmatic and eclectic basis, alongside nondirect marketing elements, and in which the use of such techniques is normally seen as direct marketing\". He suggests that two definitions may be needed: a general, inclusive definition of direct marketing, e.g. the DMA-definition, which allows any use of any direct marketing technique to be recognized as an instance of direct marketing, and a definition of a direct marketing system, e.g. Bauer and Miglautsch''s definition, covering cases where a product or service is marketed exclusively by direct marketing methods (Schofield 1995: 37). This distinction suggests that several levels of direct marketing can be distinguished. The definition of direct marketing as proposed by Raaijmaakers et al. (1992) allows for distinguishing several levels of direct marketing without the need for more than one definition. They stress the importance of direct relationships and the specific use of marketing instruments. Based on their definition, four levels of direct marketing can be distinguished (Hoekstra 1994). Three of them concern strategic decisions and one is at the operational level (see table 1). These types cover the ever broadening field of direct marketing, including the direct marketing system as well as the use of direct marketing methods.marketing ;",

It critically examines existing definitions, such as those by Bauer and Miglautsch (1992) and Schofield (1995), highlighting their limitations in encompassing the full scope of direct marketing practices. The authors advocate for Raaijmaakers et al.'s (1992) definition, which emphasizes direct relationships and specific marketing instrument usage, allowing for the distinction of four levels, covering both strategic and operational aspects, and integrating both direct marketing systems and individual direct marketing methods."

We examine some of the key reasons for marketing’s demise, and discuss how the status of marketing may be restored by demonstrating the value of marketing to the business community. We attribute marketing’s demise to several related key factors: narrow typecasting, marginalisation and limited involvement in product development, questionable marketing curricula, insensitivity toward environmental change, questionable professional standards and roles, and marketing’s apparent lack of accountability to CEOs. Each of these leads to failure to communicate, create, or deliver value within marketing.

The present paper will debate whether this is due to lack of understanding of the role of marketing, lack of acceptance as a valid management discipline suitable for professional services or lack of legitimacy as a profession in its own right. A brief overview of the role of marketing will be followed by a discussion on the professions, professional legitimacy and the professional organisation. Qualitative research was done in the form of in-depth interviews with marketing executives and accountancy and law professionals in fourteen firms across the UK. The research has revealed generational differences, misconceptions and outright conflict leading to resistance in the introduction and application of marketing, although the professionals have individually practiced a wide variety of marketing activities in their pursuit of gaining and maintaining clients.  There has been a conspicuous resistance to the acceptance of marketing as a management tool within certain firms.

    "abstract": "While it is well-established that travel costs impact on customer preference toward local service providers, research about how this situation affects competitive marketing strategies remains sparse. This paper investigates, in a local market with two competing service providers, whether service providers should undertake defensive marketing, targeted at the nearest customers who typically prefer their offering for convenience and/or offensive marketing, directed to relatively remote customers who favor the rival as the closest alternative. We find that the service providers can exclusively undertake either defensive marketing or offensive marketing or combine the two in a full differentiated strategy at the equilibrium. We compare the outcomes of these three strategic options to identify the conditions under which they are worth implementing. Main findings suggest that service providers are better off undertaking offensive marketing alone when their rival’s retaliatory offensive capacity is weak and customers incur small travel costs. Otherwise, service providers may exclusively undertake defensive marketing or combine it with offensive marketing when travel costs become significant. Also, service providers should not invest in any marketing activity when they have no market power, like in the case of two adjacent outlets in a mall. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed.MEC under projects ECO2014-52343-P and ECO2017-82227-P (AEI) and by Junta de Castilla y León under projects VA024P17 and VA105G18, co-financed by FEDER fund",

    "summary": "This publication systematically examines the application of moral standards to marketing decisions, behaviors, and institutions, positioning marketing ethics as a subset of broader business ethics. It distinguishes between positive marketing ethics, which describes current practices (e.g., prevalence of ethical codes, deceptive advertising violations), and normative marketing ethics, which prescribes how marketing \"ought\" to operate based on moral standards. The discussion emphasizes the use of moral theories in marketing situations. This work is crucial for understanding the ethical dimensions of marketing, business ethics, and corporate social responsibility."

Rising population and recent growth in GDP has made Iran one of the greatest rice importer countries all over the world. That is why rice marketing has always been a controversial issue in Iran`s agricultural economics. To study rice marketing system in Iran, this paper aims to calculate rice marketing margin, market efficiency and marketing cost coefficient in seaside Mazandaran province( where 70 percent of domestic rice production is obtained )Over the period 2000-2010. Results show that firstly HYV`s wholesale marketing margin is less than local varieties in 2000 while this trend is reversed in 2010. Secondly, retail marketing margin, total marketing margin, market efficiency and cost marketing coefficient for local varieties are all greater than HYV. Consequently, agricultural cooperative`s encouragement would lead to decrease in rice marketing margin and role of traders and raises rice farmers earningsMazandaran Province, Marketing Margin, Rice, Marketing, Q13,",

The study aims to calculate rice marketing margin, market efficiency, and marketing cost coefficients. Key findings indicate that in 2000, high-yielding varieties (HYV) had lower wholesale marketing margins than local varieties, a trend reversed by 2010. Additionally, retail and total marketing margins, market efficiency, and cost marketing coefficients were greater for local varieties. The research concludes that encouraging agricultural cooperatives could reduce rice marketing margins, diminish the role of traders, and ultimately increase farmers' earnings, thereby improving marketing efficiency."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the amphibious influence maximization (AIM) model\nthat combines traditional marketing via content providers and viral marketing\nto consumers in social networks in a single framework. In AIM, a set of content\nproviders and consumers form a bipartite network while consumers also form\ntheir social network, and influence propagates from the content providers to\nconsumers and among consumers in the social network following the independent\ncascade model. An advertiser needs to select a subset of seed content providers\nand a subset of seed consumers, such that the influence from the seed providers\npassing through the seed consumers could reach a large number of consumers in\nthe social network in expectation.\n  We prove that the AIM problem is NP-hard to approximate to within any\nconstant factor via a reduction from Feige's k-prover proof system for 3-SAT5.\nWe also give evidence that even when the social network graph is trivial (i.e.\nhas no edges), a polynomial time constant factor approximation for AIM is\nunlikely. However, when we assume that the weighted bi-adjacency matrix that\ndescribes the influence of content providers on consumers is of constant rank,\na common assumption often used in recommender systems, we provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm that achieves approximation ratio of\n$(1-1/e-\\epsilon)^3$ for any (polynomially small) $\\epsilon > 0$.

Following the analysis of transnational stakeholders’ causal scope(s) to learn about the cause and consequence of the transnational stakeholders’ relationships and interactions, an initial conceptual framework of knowledge management for TNE marketing is proposed. Practical insights from different TNE markets are developed in support of this novel knowledge management capacity building framework of TNE, and its generalisation perspectives and future research areas are discussed.\n\nPractical implications – These insights will be useful for TNE administrators to better align their knowledge management perspectives and propositions with their transnational stakeholders to underpin TNE marketing. Academics will be able to use these insights as a basis for future research.\n\nOriginality/value – This study proposes a novel conceptual stakeholder-centred capacity building framework for TNE’s knowledge management to uphold TNE marketing and supports the framework, based on practical insights from three different transnational markets",

    "abstract": "New Zealand has gone through a radical metamorphosis since free market economics were introduced in the mid-1980s. Marketing managers are particularly interested in the views of consumers about issues dealing with marketing activities. Negative views could signal consumer backlash against free market activities. This study examines the views of consumers from 1986 to 2001 on a range of issues dealing with marketing and consumerism. The results clearly show that consumers are less negative about marketing and consumerism issues since 1986. It seems likely that New Zealand has evolved in terms of the consumerism life cycle over the last 15 years. Marketing managers should continue to remain proactive in their responses to consumer discontents. Implications for New Zealand and for other countries are addressed",

Despite the significance of corporate environmental strategy to firms adopting a triple-bottom line performance evaluation, there is insufficient focus on strategic green marketing and its impact on a firm’s competitiveness. This study fills the gap by providing a comprehensive view of strategic green marketing and its impact on competitive advantage. Findings also reveal the moderating role of internal green marketing actions towards the development of a sustained competitive advantage. Specifically, the findings build on contemporary green marketing literature suggesting that a significant interplay between strategy and people exists which enhances the creation of competitive advantage. This in turn increases financial performance. Finally, this research uses an updated approach to build on current literature concerning the drivers and outcomes of strategic green marketing. This provides managers with nuanced insights about environmentally-driven competitive advantage",

It further suggests that the level engagement which these chef brands can achieve is unmatched by the consumer goods brands and retailers within food marketing. It argues that while the cookbooks under these brands clearly act as product and merchandise that they should also be considered as part of the brand's marketing communication toolkit: that they play a role in driving consumer loyalty to the brand by effectively communicating its brand values and attributes. It concludes that traditional consumer goods and retailers within the grocery sector need to re-evaluate the range of marketing communications tools available to respond to the brand dominance of the celebrity chef and rethink traditional models of endorsement as they may be doing more to build the celebrity brand than associated consumer goods.

The traditional view of marketing is that it is a process by which people and firms get what they require and desire by generating and trading value with others (Kotler and Armstrong, 2010). Nonetheless, a more recent view of marketing is that it provides a vehicle to aid the achievement of a wide range of social goals. In this instance, fuel poverty and energy efficiency. For example, social marketing could be used as a means of ‘engaging’ fuel poverty groups to improve the energy efficiency of their home.

    "abstract": "The scientific community advocates that enhancing smallholder farmers’ access to reliable, ready and direct market channel is a prerequisite to the attainment of sustainable food supply and poverty reduction in the developing world including Ghana.\r\nHowever, the smallholder farmers' access to direct marketing channels in Ghana has been a critical challenge; therefore, this study aims to analyse the factors that influence smallholder paddy rice farmers’ decision to participate in either the direct marketing channel specifically processors or the indirect marketing channel specifically, middlemen in the Northern Region of Ghana. Purposive sampling was used to select farmers from three rice growing districts in the Northern Region of Ghana. The study employed the Binary Logit regression model in the analysis of the factors affecting farmers’ choices of marketing channel. A t-test was also used to compare the mean yields and revenues generated by farmers who marketed their paddy rice outputs in the direct and indirect marketing channels. A five-point Likert scale was used to rank the constraints that affect the production and marketing of rice output among rice farmers.\r\nThe study revealed that a lower percentage of farmers sold their paddy rice output to processors (direct channel). The Logit model showed that farm size, the price of paddy rice output per 85kg bag, access to market information and access to credit increased the farmers' participation in the direct marketing channel whereas payment period and ownership of bicycle reduced farmers' their participation. The t-test result revealed that the participation in the direct marketing channel raised farmers' revenue. The study further showed that limited access to credit, poor climatic condition, the high cost of labour, the high cost of farm inputs and low mechanisation were the top five production challenges they encountered in their rice production. Low market prices, post-harvest losses, the high cost of transportation, limited market option and low demand for local rice were the top-ranked marketing constraints reported by farmers. The study concludes that it is more profitable for farmers to sell their paddy rice output to processors instead of middlemen. Therefore, policymakers need to incorporate the significant factors of farmers’ choices of marketing channels in the formulation of agricultural policy that seeks to promote farmers’ access to direct marketing channels in developing countries including Ghana",

In this paper we address the extent to which economic freedom, understood as market economy oriented institutions and policies, matters for entrepreneurial activity through a panel data analysis for 78 countries during the period 2001-2012. We examine the relationship between the Fraser Institute’s economic freedom index and its five areas, and three entrepreneurial activity indicators from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, namely total entrepreneurial activity, necessity entrepreneurship and opportunity entrepreneurship. Economic freedom seems to increase opportunity entrepreneurship and decrease necessity entrepreneurship. Focusing on the OECD countries, we highlight that economic freedom is positively associated with entrepreneurship.

    "abstract": "Understanding what fosters -- and hinders -- firm formation and growth at the metropolitan level across the United States is a challenge. Entrepreneurship can be measured by a variety of indicators, and they each can tell somewhat different stories. Furthermore, because entrepreneurship can refer to the growth of firms from a startup stage to mid- or large-scale, no one dataset covers the full range of companies that fall in this category. This report contributes to the Kauffman Foundation's recent series of analyses on the rate of business creation in metropolitan areas. Going beyond identifying metropolitan areas with higher rates of entrepreneurship, we analyze what regional factors are associated, or unassociated, with entrepreneurial activity. Understanding what drives entrepreneurship at the regional level -- especially high-growth business creation -- will help policymakers and entrepreneurship supporters know where to invest their efforts",

However, the importance of entrepreneurship in economic theory is not new and consistent interest in this topic can be traced back to almost a century ago. As with any young discipline, the role and content of entrepreneurship education remains controversial. It seems difficult to decide if entrepreneurship is rather “science” than “art”, or if can be divided between teachable and non-teachable elements, or if entrepreneurship courses should focus on the advancement of personal enterprising attributes or on the ability to start, develop and manage a firm. This paper questions the relevance and appropriateness of entrepreneurship education.

Though it can be argued that the transition countries started from more or less the same point when they embarked on their transitional path, in this paper, we indicate a number of the differences in initial conditions which further influenced SME development. By surveying the existing literature on SME development, this paper illustrates that as the transition process progresses, entrepreneurship development in transition countries is a story of increasing divergence. The transitional context provides unique opportunities for entrepreneurship activities to develop. However, at the same time this environment presents unique challenges for entrepreneurial development especially knowledge-based entrepreneurship as the free-market system matures within a context with low levels of SMEs and inherited negative views towards entrepreneurship",

Specifically, it explores within sample groups of learners:\n\n\n\nRQ1.\tWhat is the typical profile of the international students’ prior education and work experience? \n\nRQ2.\tWhat do students expect from studying an entrepreneurship PG course in the UK?\n\nRQ3.\tWhat are their experiences of, and learning outcomes from, the entrepreneurship course?\n\nRQ4.\tWhat benefits regarding their skills and knowledge do they perceive result from participation?\n\n\n\nPrior Work\n\nInternational Postgraduate education has grown substantially in the last decade (UUK, 2010). There has been significant growth in international postgraduate student participation in UK business related subjects, involving both MBA and other Masters’ programmes such as MSc in Management and a range of specialist awards, which increasingly offer Entrepreneurship as a core or option. Prior research focuses on transnational comparisons between France, Germany and Poland (Packham et al, 2010) USA, Spain and China (Pruett et al, 2009) Africa and Europe (Davey et al, 2011) China (Millman et al, 2010) and Poland (Jones, et al, 2011) with relatively little research specifically addressing entrepreneurship for international students on postgraduate courses in the UK (Hall and Sung, 2009, Liu, 2010). \n\n\n\nApproach\n\nThis article originates in the authors’ experiences in running postgraduate entrepreneurship modules for international students in UK Business Schools. They found that students often experienced concerns about a ‘mismatch’ between their expectations of UK business and management education and their actual experiences, with experiences of cultural tensions between prior learning experiences and their acculturation to the requirements and norms of UK business education. The study is a microcosm of a wider issue as these concerns are shared more generally by international Postgraduate students.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThe results confirmed that career development was a major motivator for international study in the UK. Interest in entrepreneurship is increasing but there are tensions between the expectations of the postgraduate experience and the experienced reality. Entrepreneurship was in some cases seen as a distinctive ‘peak experience’, but cultural factors, learning effectiveness and linguistic capability need to be addressed in designing learning programmes.\n\n\n\nImplications\n\nThe study contributes new evidence and ideas to the debate on entrepreneurship education in meeting the career expectations and motivations of international postgraduate students participating in entrepreneurship education, especially in the light of new curricular guidance (QAA, 2012) and UK government regulation.\n\n\n\nValue\n\nIt offers suggestions for educators on the effective design and delivery of entrepreneurship for international students in the rapidly changing and competitive postgraduate market",

    "abstract": "How, why, and under what conditions can social movements contribute to the development of social entrepreneurial process developed by embedded actors? Social entrepreneurship scholars are increasingly adopting social movement theories to explain how individual entrepreneurs develop their social ventures. Despite the synergies achieved when combining social movement with social entrepreneurship literature, social entrepreneurial outcomes are still mostly explained by the efforts of atomistic actors. In this paper we offer an embedded perspective on social entrepreneurship and social movement, which enables us to examine their complementary features in a sustainable development project in a Dutch region. While contentious activity did not produce the desired effect in our case, we found that the various stages of social entrepreneurship processes (opportunity identification, evaluation, formalization, and exploitation) through which embedded actors develop their ventures were especially enhanced by joint knowledge creation between movements and embedded actors, the construction of producer identities, and direct business support. This study contributes to the social movement literature by showing how movements can bring about change by providing embedded actors with producers’ identities and hands-on support. The literature on social entrepreneurship is also complemented, as we show how motives and behaviors to engage in social entrepreneurship are shaped by social movements, in combination with changes in the degree of embeddedness",

It has also been related to the concept of firm ownership (e.g. Foss and Klein, 2005). This may lead to the conjecture that a collectively-owned firm is a setting for collective entrepreneurship. However, such reasoning encounters a number of taxing questions. If entrepreneurship is usually related to the individual, how does the collective embody entrepreneurial spirit and lead to effective outcomes? These and other questions will be addressed in this paper, which is mainly based on a review of the literature. The paper starts by providing an overview of the different schools of (economic) thought on entrepreneurship. Subsequently we discuss the implications for the conceptualization of entrepreneurship when it is not carried out by an individual but by a group of people. Finally, the notion of collective entrepreneurship will be framed within the context of the producer-owned firm in agriculture, by considering conditions under which collective entrepreneurship can be attributed to the cooperative.entreprepreneurship, cooperative, pro, Agribusiness, Industrial Organization,",

    "abstract": "Recently there has been a growing interest in the use of corporate entrepreneurship as a means for corporations to enhance the innovative abilities of their employees and, at the same time, increase corporate success through the creation of new corporate ventures. However, the creation of corporate activity is difficult since it involves radically changing internal organisational behaviour patterns. Researchers have attempted to understand the factors that stimulate or impede corporate entrepreneurship. They examined the effect of a firm’s strategy, organisation and external environment. It appears that the environment plays a profound role is influencing corporate entrepreneurship whereas there is consensus that the external environment is an important antecedent of corporate entrepreneurship. Focus on the environment, the literature highlights two research questions that deserve examination. First, how do firms that compete in different environments vary in the corporate entrepreneurship activities? Second, which corporate entrepreneurship activities are conductive to superior performance in different environments? This paper develops the theoretical foundation of theses questions and focuses on the relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and strategic management in a integrating model of corporate entrepreneurship, giving special attention to the strategic behaviour, corporate context and organisational types.Corporate Entrepreneurship, Strategy",

    "abstract": "Entrepreneurship training and development in the context of higher education has grown tremendously over the past four decades. What began as offerings of a handful of courses aimed primarily at business planning and small business management has evolved into over 3.000 higher education institutions around the world offering degree programs and concentrations in entrepreneurship on both undergraduate and graduate levels (Morris, Kuratko and Cornwall, 2013). Universities – particularly in the USA, UK and EU – have invested into developing entrepreneurship curricula but also extra-curricular programs and infrastructure aimed at supporting enterprise development. \r\nIt is consensus among educators that entrepreneurship can be taught (Kuratko, 2005). Indeed, entrepreneurship education research has become a field in its own right (Fayolle, Gailly and Lassas‐Clerc, 2006; Pittaway and Cope, 2007; Penaluna, Penaluna and Jones, 2012; Fayolle, 2013; Fayolle and Gailly, 2015; Pittaway et al., 2015; Nabi et al., 2017). As literature indicates, entrepreneurship education can have an important impact on a variety of outcomes, including entrepreneurial intentions and behaviours. Intentions are a motivation to engage in certain behaviour that is geared towards venture creation (Gibb, 2008, 2011) as well as recognition and exploitation of opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). Moreover, research has also identified the impact of entrepreneurship education on more subjective indicators such as attitudes (Boukamcha, 2015), perceived feasibility (Rauch and Hulsink, 2015), and skills and knowledge (Greene and Saridakis, 2008).\r\nRecently, the literature on the best practices in entrepreneurship education has centred on the importance of experiential learning allowing students to create knowledge from their interactions with the environment (Kolb, 1984). The key to effective experiential learning is engaging students individually and socially in a situation that enables them to interact with elements of the entrepreneurial context thus moving them away from text-driven to action-driven learning mode (Morris, Kuratko and Cornwall, 2013). Increasingly, digital technologies have been leveraged to create a learning environment that provides opportunities for experiential learning (Onyema and Daniil, 2017). \r\nThis chapter provides findings of a study related to the development and implementation of a collaborative, digitally supported simulation project aimed at enhancing entrepreneurial social skills in an international context",

This combination is applied to the internationalisation of UK universities to establish areas of overlap and to propose that an emergent strategic approach, resulting in an ‘umbrella strategy’ for internationalisation, is most appropriate and can be effectively executed in HE through corporate entrepreneurship. The review uses research and concepts from both private and public sectors. It recommends the adoption in HE of a broader definition of entrepreneurship and an ethical approach to internationalisation in order to appeal to the values of academics.   Entrepreneurship can be conceptualised as part of university culture, and, as such, central to the execution of internationalisation",

What if the decision to found a new venture were thought of as one of many options that individuals consider as they try to structure a meaningful and rewarding career? How would the field of entrepreneurship research be different? In our view, there is much to be learned by conceiving of entrepreneurship not solely as a final destination, but as a step along a career trajectory. Doing so opens the study of entrepreneurship to a wider range of scholarly insights, and promises important insights for entrepreneurial practice, training, and policy.

The analysis is based on a census of entrepreneurship courses and curricula run by Italian universities in 2004 and 2010. Entrepreneurship education in Italian universities is in its early development. Up to 2004 only a few universities had courses dedicated to entrepreneurship and the majority of them dealt with the development of the business plan. This situation has only slightly improved in the following years. Courses and curricula are mostly within business schools while very few exist in engineering and science schools. This situation contrasts with the need for entrepreneurship education in the Italian economy. Given the importance of traditional sectors in Italian industry we need to stimulate start-up in high-tech sectors: the development of entrepreneurship courses in engineering and in other science curricula could play an important role in this sense. At the same time we need to favor the growth process of small firms; this requires people who are able to play an entrepreneurial role in established firms.entrepreneurship education, university courses, intrapreneurship, entrepreneurial competences.",

    "abstract": "Entrepreneurship is usually indentified as an important determinant of aggregate productivity and long-term growth. The determinants of entrepreneurship, nevertheless, are not entirely understood. A recent literature has linked entrepreneurship to the development of the justice system. This paper contributes to this literature by evaluating the role of access to justice in determining the incidence of entrepreneurship. We explore the creation of Special Civil Tribunals in the Brazilian state of São Paulo during the 1990s. Special Civil Tribunals increased the geographic presence of the justice system, simplified judicial procedures, and increased the speed of adjudication of disputes. Using census data, and difference-in-differences and instrumental variable strategies, we find that implementation of Special Civil Tribunals led to increased entrepreneurship, defined as the probability that individuals are employers or selfemployed. Results are particularly strong and robust for the case of self-employment, and do not seem to be related to other changes in infrastructure or public good provision at the local level, or to pre-existing trends in entrepreneurship.access to justice, courts, entrepreneurship, institutions, Brazil Jel Codes: K1, K41, K42, H41, O12, O17, O54",

Baumol’s classificatory scheme is built around a limited concept of first-best outcomes and therefore easily fails to appreciate the true impact of entrepreneurship in real world circumstances characterized by suboptimal institutions. We present an alternative way of generalizing the notion of entrepreneurship and show how and why it encompasses the Baumol typology as a special case. Our main distinction is between business and institutional entrepreneurship. We draw on Schumpeter’s notion of creative destruction and reintroduce the entrepreneur as a potential disturber of an institutional equilibrium. Various subsets of institutional entrepreneurship are posited and discussed. It is shown that changing the workings of institutions constitutes an important set of entrepreneurial profit opportunities. An implication of this is that entrepreneurial efforts to reform or offset inefficient institutions can in some cases be welfare-improving.Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Institutions",

    "summary": "This paper reconsiders Baumol's (1990) typology of entrepreneurship (productive, unproductive, destructive), arguing its reliance on first-best outcomes limits its applicability in real-world suboptimal institutional contexts. The authors propose an alternative generalization, distinguishing between business and institutional entrepreneurship. Drawing on Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction, they reintroduce the entrepreneur as a potential disruptor of institutional equilibrium. The study discusses various subsets of institutional entrepreneurship and demonstrates that altering institutional workings presents significant entrepreneurial profit opportunities. A key implication is that entrepreneurial efforts to reform or mitigate inefficient institutions can sometimes improve welfare, offering new perspectives on entrepreneurship, innovation, and institutions."

    "title": "How Diverse is Entrepreneurship? Observations on the social heterogeneity of self-employment in Germany",
    "abstract": "The discussion on entrepreneurship often treats entrepreneurs as agents of ideas of economic change and growth. Entrepreneurs are considered to serve as potential multipliers delivering individual and social wealth and prosperity. In that context entrepreneurship has been treated as a rather homogenous category, internal differences were not in the focus of academic talk. In public policy discourse entrepreneurship and the labour market category of self-employment are often used interchangeably. Images and interpretation of self-employment are mostly based on comparison of self-employment with other categories of wage or salary dependent labour market groups. This way self-employed people prove to become an averaged one-type figure. The proposed paper wants to highlight the other side of economic and social reality: the heterogeneity of self-employment. Referring to empirical data for the case of Germany the argumentation intends to illuminate different levels of social and economic integration of self-employed people. Working parameters and firm sizes, economic sectors of activity, income patterns, working hours and biographies have diversified and became increasingly heterogeneous so that further discussion is ultimately provoked: Which entrepreneurship are we talking about when talking entrepreneurship? Where are links between different fractions of the category of self-employment compared to each other and to other socio-economic groups? The contribution must be regarded as a theoretical and empirical task to connect entrepreneurship with debate on innovation, culture and finance.self-employment; heterogeneity; entrepreneurship",

    "abstract": "This paper aims at explaining cross-country variation in nascent entrepreneurship. Regression analysis is applied using various explanatory variables derived from three different approaches. We make use of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor database, including nascent entrepreneurship rates for 36 countries in 2002 as well as variables from standardized national statistics. The first approach relates the level of entrepreneurship of a country to its level of economic development. We found evidence for a U-shaped relationship. The second approach deals with a regime switch where the innovative advantage moves from large, established enterprises to small and new firms, because new technologies have reduced the importance of scale economies in many sectors. The third approach assumes that nascent entrepreneurship depends upon aggregate conditions such as technology, demography, culture and institutions, influencing opportunities, resources, skills and preferences. Several indicators of these aggregate conditions are found to correlate with nascent entrepreneurship. A full model combining the three approaches includes a U-shaped relationship with per capita income as well as with Porter's innovative capacity index, in addition to effects of social security expenditure (-) and the total business ownership rate (+). Finally, a (former) communist-country dummy plays an important role.",

    "abstract": "The current empirical entrepreneurship literature mainly shows a positive correlation between entrepreneurship (measured as the number of startups) and economic growth. However, the mechanisms by which entrepreneurship exerts its positive influence are not obvious. The net result of startups on employment or GDP can be negative, at least in the short run, since efficient, new companies may lead to closures of less efficient ones. Based on an assumption that economic entrepreneurship in the form of startups creates unobserved supply side effects on the firm level (Fritsch & Mueller 2004) and entrepreneurial social capital on community level (Westlund & Bolton 2003) this paper studies the connections between startups and local development at the municipal level in Sweden between 2000 and 2008. We use a unique database including not only total startups, but data on startups divided in six branches to study the impact of entrepreneurship on population and employment growth. Analyses are performed on all municipalities as well as by municipality type and by growth rate.",

    "abstract": "© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Economic, environmental, and social limits of the current capitalist mode of production have led to a rethinking and reconceptualisation of economic processes and models including the role of businesses in sustainable development. While green economies and more specifically green entrepreneurs have been identified as agents of change that can challenge the mainstream and seek to induce environmental, social, and ethical transformation of society, much research has stayed within existing models of thinking predominantly rooted in technocratic approaches (e.g. ecological modernisation and more recently transition studies). This paper seeks to offer an alternative understanding of green entrepreneurship that breaks open these discussions using an environmental justice frame that focuses on the role of extra-economic discourses in shaping the social relations of economic systems. By drawing on an exemplary case study of “just” entrepreneurship from Boston, Massachusetts, USA, the paper seeks to start a conversation around the ideas of green entrepreneurship and environmental justice as vehicles to deliver potentially broader system changes and explores both conceptual and practical aspects of green development. As such, it offers (1) evidence of a just green economy that can be realised within existing capitalist structures as well as (2) a different conceptual entry point to understanding green entrepreneurship",

    "abstract": "The promotion of international staff mobility is a founding principle of the ‘Bologna Process’, designed to create a converged system of higher education across Europe as it is subjected to increasing globalisation. Many UK ‘new’ (ie post-1992) universities are engaged in the development of internationalisation and globalisation strategies which include staff exchange. Meanwhile, the failure to execute strategy is increasingly acknowledged as a major problem in organisational performance. Using a first-, second and third-person Insider Action Research (AR) approach, six chronological cycles of AR were enacted over a 28 month period in order to organise and implement an international staff exchange between universities in the UK and France. Data generated were subjected to a double process of analysis – four phase analysis and a meta-cycle of enquiry - in order to propose aspects of strategy execution through strategic entrepreneurship within the constraints of a post-1992 university business school in the UK. Concepts from the theoretical literature in three domains - entrepreneurship in higher education, globalisation of higher education and strategy execution through strategic entrepreneurship – are combined with the research analysis to propose that ‘strategic entrepreneurs’ can execute the riskier elements of an internationalisation strategy, such as staff exchange. This work broadens AR from education into strategic management. It goes beyond the common, well-intentioned and yet vague statements involving the ‘encouragement’ of international staff exchange to propose the elements of execution through strategic entrepreneurship",

    "summary": "This address discusses the factors contributing to American entrepreneurship, noting that over 70% of adult Americans prefer entrepreneurship to working for others, significantly higher than in Western Europe or Japan. The speaker explores the role of an 'entrepreneurial spirit' and a supportive policy environment, arguing that these two elements are interconnected. The presentation emphasizes the importance of carefully crafting policies to avoid restricting this entrepreneurial spirit, which is considered a vital resource for U.S. economic dynamism, and touches on challenges like rising healthcare costs and tort reform."

    "abstract": "Parker and Van Praag (2009) showed, based on theory, that the group status of the profession 'entrepreneurship' shapes people's occupational preferences and thus their choice behavior. The current study focuses on the determinants and consequences of the group status of a profession, entrepreneurship in particular. If the group status of entrepreneurship is related to individual choice behavior, it is policy relevant to better understand this relationship and the determinants of the status of the entrepreneur. For reasons outlined in the introduction, this study focuses on (800) students in the Netherlands. We find that the status of occupations is mostly determined by the required level of education, the income level to be expected and respect. Furthermore, our results imply that entrepreneurship is associated with hard work, high incomes, but little power and education. Moreover, we find evidence that individual characteristics, such as entrepreneurship experience, vary systematically with the perceived status of occupations, thereby contributing ammunition to a fundamental discussion in the literature. Finally, we find a strong association between the perceived status of the entrepreneur and the estimated likelihood and willingness to become an entrepreneur.entrepreneurship, self-employment, occupational choice, occupational status, group status, peer group effects",

    "abstract": "Social entrepreneurship and other new forms such as ecological or sustainable entrepreneurship have emerged as promising new solutions to solve societal problems. Therefore these types of sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship also increasingly attract the interest of researchers, but there is no clear theoretical concept for these emerging research areas yet. As for commercial entrepreneurship, existing research has neglected the influence of contextual factors on the entrepreneurial process. Therefore this topic is not well researched yet and requires an increase in knowledge to keep up with its popularity and potential impact on society. Therefore the research purpose of this study was to systematically analyse how contextual factors, i.e. political &amp; legal, economic, technological, environmental, social and cultural factors, influence the stages of the entrepreneurial process and if this influence differs for commercial and sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs. To fulfill this purpose a theoretical framework depicting the entrepreneurial process in its context was developed, which incorporates the different types of entrepreneurship based on the value they create. In order to adequately explore the research purpose our theoretical framework was applied to the context of Central America. In line with our interpretivistic standpoint we followed an inductive approach with a qualitative, comparative research design of an exploratory nature. We collected secondary data about Central America and conducted a multiple-case study in which we collected primary data from 13 interviews with entrepreneurs being active in Central America. The empirical findings were thoroughly analysed and discussed leading to several interesting results which were used to revise our theoretical framework. Despite a great variety among entrepreneurs we realised that they all undergo the entrepreneurial process and we could therefore successfully apply our theoretical framework. All entrepreneurs are differently influenced by contextual factors in their entrepreneurial process, but disparities are mostly due to the background of the entrepreneurs or the type of venture. Some political and legal, and economic factors have been found to influence commercial and sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs differently, while other economic and social factors rather determine differences between non-profit and for- profit oriented entrepreneurs. This study contributes to theories regarding the influence of contextual factors and concepts in the field of (sustainability-oriented) entrepreneurship as well as methodologies used in this field. It provides considerable practical contributions to entrepreneurs and recommendations for policy-makers which can lead to valuable societal contributions. Throughout the research ethical issues have been considered and quality criteria applied to ensure the trustworthiness of this research.",

The role of EEE in enabling graduates to develop entrepreneurial intentions and career plans is therefore of major importance. This paper explores how EEE can influence postgraduate entrepreneurship and career initiation in the context of the New Era economy at an international level.\n\n\n\nMethodology/Approach\n\nThe paper explores the learning experiences of a group of 60 postgraduate international students who completed an Entrepreneurship programme at the University of Lincoln which included the development of personal learning narratives and career plans. The students were exposed to the Opportunity-centred entrepreneurship approach and the ‘Entrepreneurial Effectiveness’ model in the QAA guidelines (2012). Their narratives were analysed to assess:\n\n-\tPrior career intentions\n\n-\tProposed career intentions resulting from the EEE programme\n\n-\tApplication of learning arising from the EEE programme\n\n-\tA survey of students was used to validate the narratives\n\n\n\nFindings\n\nEEE has a wider influence on personal development and career planning than simply the intention to create new ventures. This paper builds on a prior study of international postgraduate students’ orientation to entrepreneurship education in their expectations of UK Higher Education, which confirmed that career development is a major motivator for international study in the UK (Rae & Woodier-Harris, 2012). The paper contributes new understanding of the relationships between EEE and graduate career intentions, especially at PG and international levels. The paper explores personal growth, confidence and identity development, formation of new career intentions and the application of learning. The international dimension is considerable and this is discussed.\n\n\n\nImplications\n\nThe paper has implications for the marketing, design and delivery of EEE at international and HE institutional levels, as well as for the practices of educators in designing, validating and delivering programmes for entrepreneurial career development, at national and international levels.\n\n\n\nOriginality/Value\n\nThe paper contributes new understanding to the role of EEE in postgraduate career initiation at international level in a period of significant and complex economic transformation",

    "abstract": "In a report recently produced by the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship (NCGE), the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) and the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE) concluded that ‘Entrepreneurship education is currently taught primarily through modules in business school courses and extra-curricular activities. HEIs need to enhance the perception and relevance of entrepreneurship education, so students and staff recognise the value of its combination of innovation, creativity, collaboration and risk-taking skills to a wide range of disciplines’. This paper focuses on a ground breaking programme specifically designed to address these criticisms of the way in which enterprise and entrepreneurship is taught in universities. There are a huge number of programmes on offer across within European Higher Education with the words ‘enterprise’ and ‘entrepreneurship’ in the title, but what makes the BA (Hons) Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Management unique is the close involvement of entrepreneurs right from the outset, including course design, module content and delivery. This is achieved through an ‘entrepreneur in residence’ network, with Walter Herriot, Managing Director of St John’s Innovation Centre, Cambridge, one of the world’s leading incubation centres, as Director. This enables leading entrepreneurs to be embedded in fabric of the programme through playing a very active role in the continued development of the curriculum, content, and delivery of the pathway. Additionally, each student is allocated an entrepreneur as mentor for the duration of the three year programme. This paper will firstly explore the key issues raised by the policy community and others calling into question the appropriateness of the way in which enterprise and entrepreneurship is taught. It will then look at the way in which UK universities are responding to these comments. The paper concludes with a case study of an academic programme developed and delivered jointly by academics and practitioners.entrepreneurship; education; enterprise education.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses criticisms of entrepreneurship education in universities, advocating for enhanced perception and relevance by integrating innovation, creativity, collaboration, and risk-taking skills across disciplines. It details a unique BA (Hons) Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Management program that embeds entrepreneurs directly into course design, content, and delivery through an \"entrepreneur in residence\" network and student mentorships. The paper explores policy issues, UK university responses, and presents this program as a case study of academic-practitioner collaboration in entrepreneurship and enterprise education."

    "title": "Attitudes of Higher Education students to new venture creation: a preliminary approach to the Portuguese case",
    "abstract": "Institutions of higher education have an important role in the generation of high tech ‘entrepreneurial capacity’. Being entrepreneurship in Portugal an emergent phenomenon there is an urgent need to better understand and develop this area not only by analysing the ‘supply side’ (i.e., the courses taught in this field) but also the ‘demand side’, that is, the attitudes of students, future potential entrepreneurs, to new venture creation. Based on 4413 responses of students enrolled in Portuguese higher education institutions, gathered in June-July 2008, we found, using a multivariate model, that students who had already created a firm although, on average, possess larger entrepreneurial experience and knowledge, they do not reveal high risk propensity or creativity. Those students that have taken some steps to create new businesses and, to a larger extent, those foreseeing their future career as owning their business have higher risk and creative profiles. Students who live in an environment which ‘breads’ entrepreneurship have stronger desire to become entrepreneurs. This supports the contention that entrepreneurship is a learned process and that school, teachers, and other institutions and individuals may encourage entrepreneurial behaviours. ‘Role models’ seem indeed to constitute a key factor fostering entrepreneurship among Portuguese higher education students – in the Portuguese case, the entrepreneur and entrepreneurial company references are, respectively, Belmiro de Azevedo and Sonae. Although in a descriptive analysis students enrolled in non-university (e.g., polytechnics) and private higher education institutions reveal higher effective and potential entrepreneurial propensities, when we (simultaneously) control for a vast number of factors which are likely to affect entrepreneurship propensity, such differences cease to be statistically relevant. Students’ personality (risk, creativity) and demographic traits (gender and age), competencies and familiarity with entrepreneurship (entrepreneurial experience, knowledge, awareness, interest), and contextual factors (professional experience, role models) are important determinants of entrepreneurial propensity, whereas the type of higher education institutions (public vs private, non-university vs university), and, to some extent, the degree (postgraduate vs undergraduate), and the scientific area, fail to emerge as key determinants.students; entrepreneurship; attitudes",

    "abstract": "This paper compares two datasets designed to measure entrepreneurship. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset captures early-stage entrepreneurial activity; the World Bank Group Entrepreneurship Survey dataset captures formal business registration. There are a number of important differences when the data are compared. First, GEM data tend to report significantly greater levels of early-stage entrepreneurship in developing economies than do the World Bank data. The World Bank data tend to be greater than GEM data for developed countries. Second, the magnitude of the difference between the datasets across countries is related to the local institutional and environmental conditions for entrepreneurs, after controlling for levels of economic development. A possible explanation for this is that the World Bank data measure rates of entry in the formal economy, whereas GEM data are reflective of entrepreneurial intent and capture informality of entrepreneurship. This is particularly true for developing countries. Therefore, this discrepancy can be interpreted as the spread between individuals who could potentially operate businesses in the formal sector - and those that actually do so: In other words, GEM data may represent the potential supply of entrepreneurs, whereas the World Bank data may represent the actual rate of entrepreneurship. The findings suggest that entrepreneurs in developed countries have greater ease and incentives to incorporate, both for the benefits of greater access to formal financing and labor contracts, as well as for tax and other purposes not directly related to business activities.Banks&Banking Reform,E-Business,Access to Finance,Microfinance,Information Security&Privacy",

    "title": "The impact of export-oriented entrepreneurship on regional economic growth",
    "abstract": "Although export-oriented new ventures and the field of international entrepreneurship have received considerable attention by scholars during the last decade (Oviatt and McDougla, 2005), their potential economic impact has not been sufficiently analyzed yet. To the best of our knowledge, no studies on this issue have been carried out at regional level. Despite the increasing impact of globalization, regions have emerged as the essential and active unit of economic development process (Scott and Stopper, 2003). Regions are influential environments fostering entrepreneurship (Feldman, 2000). This is especially true for knowledge-based entrepreneurship since proximity to knowledge sources matters in order to discover opportunities and exploit them (Audretsch, 1998). Moreover, regions differ culturally and economically, and such differences encourage or discourage people to venture in entrepreneurial activity. We analyze the impact of export-oriented entrepreneurship on regional growth using data provided by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor project and the Spanish Institute of Statistics, for 17 NUTS-2 Spanish regions over a period of six years. After controlling for catching-up effects (van Stel et al., 2005), as well as, other drivers of economic growth (e.g. change in technology capability and human capital), we found evidence that those regions with a higher percentage of adult population involved in export-oriented entrepreneurship experience a higher GDP growth. This relationship is greater as the level of foreign customers served by the entrepreneurial initiatives is substantially higher (i.e., at least 1%, 25% or 75% of customers located abroad). These results support those found at national level by Hessels and van Stel (2009). However, our paper adds to the extant literature on entrepreneurship by analyzing the role of entrepreneurial activity with different levels of export intensity on regional growth under a longitudinal context. Policy implications derived from these results suggest that trade policies for export promotion among new ventures should be carried out at regional level. Otherwise, exporting new ventures may concentrate only on certain regions, which would help to increase differences on growth within a nation.",

    "abstract": "A basic intellectual challenge for those concerned with the poverty of nations is to come to grips with the nature and causes of the wealth of the world?s wealthier nations. One might then be in a position to inform the poorer nations how they might achieve similar outcomes. This paper is organized around what I call ?the theory of innovative enterprise?, a perspective derived from the historical and comparative study of the development of the advanced economies. The theory of innovative enterprise provides the essential analytical link between entrepreneurship and development. Section 2 offers, as a point of departure, a contrast between entrepreneurship in rich and poor nations. Section 3 outlines the theory of the innovating firm in which entrepreneurship has a role to play. Section 4 identifies the roles of entrepreneurship in new firm formation in terms of the types of strategy, organization, and finance that innovation requires, and emphasizes the ?disappearance? of entrepreneurship with the growth of the firm. In Section 5 I argue that, in the advanced economies, successful entrepreneurship in knowledge intensive industries has depended heavily upon a combination of business allocation of resources to innovative investment strategies, and government investment in the knowledge base, state sponsored protection of markets and intellectual property rights, and state subsidies to support these business strategies. One cannot understand national economic development without understanding the role of the developmental state. At the same time, the specific agenda and ultimate success of the developmental state cannot be understood in abstraction from the dynamics of innovative enterprise. It is through the interaction of the innovative enterprise and the developmental state that entrepreneurial activity inserts itself into the economic system to contribute to the process of economic development.entrepreneurship, innovative enterprise, developmental state",

    "summary": "This study employs a neoclassical production function and a spatial Durbin model to analyze knowledge spillovers via entrepreneurship on the economic performance of 337 German districts. The authors highlight the critical role of the spatial weight matrix choice. Findings indicate positive intra-regional knowledge spillover effects through entrepreneurship, while inter-regional effects are highly dependent on the chosen weight matrix. This suggests regionally bounded knowledge spillover effects, emphasizing entrepreneurship capital, regional output, and spatial econometric approaches for understanding economic dynamics."

    "abstract": "The era of the new millennium has witnessed a wide range of the revolutionized technology that affects our lives and the way an organization is conducted. The contemporary business sectors start to recognize the potential use of knowledge management in the new organizational processes. As a result, increasing numbers of organizations pay attention to the creative value of leveraging knowledge as one of their potential assets. Therefore, organizations start to focus on knowledge as one of the important elements in competitive advantage that needs to be utilized efficiently and effectively. They have shown a great attention of knowledge management in their business strategy incorporated with technology. The role of technological tools and applications is essential in supporting and enhancing knowledge management strategy. There has been a transition from traditional information system to new a concept of knowledge management system employed by organization to sustain competitive advantage in dynamic and unstable environment. Further, to shift the paradigm of knowledge management systems concept from business sectors, this study focused on the KMS applications and tools particularly in Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) environment. The purpose of this study is to (a) identify the relationship of business strategy, knowledge management (KM) Strategy, knowledge management systems (KMS) strategy, information system (IS) strategy and information technology (IT) strategy, particularly in the context of IHE,  (b) describe those strategies and their relationship based on the context of IHE. This will provide guidance and effective methods for formulating the KMS strategy with the aim to align it with business strategies and ensuring success of its implementation",

Integrating religious moral values with other subjects, school culture, and activities significantly influences students' attitudes.

Pearce distinguishes between facilitative governments (supportive, predictable, strong) and nonfacilitative governments (hostile, erratic, weak), illustrating how the latter creates complex dependencies for managers, particularly in transitional economies like China and Hungary, where personal relationships and official good graces become crucial. The review emphasizes understanding organizations within their broader governmental context."

The authors also recommend that European states set debt targets to be reached by the end of 2014 and explain that proper incentives are necessary to ensure that an exit strategy, once implemented, is done so in coordination between various institutional actors. Such a policy framework should be in place by summer 2010, the authors say, in order to avoid a buildup of financial instability during the process.",

In many cases, a strategy is abandoned out of impatience or because of pressure for an instant payoff before it has had a chance to take root and yield results. Or its focal point is allowed to drift overtime. To navigate a strategy, one must maintain a balance between strategizing and learning modes of thinking.\nDespite worldwide attention to strategic planning, the notion of strategic practice is surprisingly new. This owes to widespread perception that strategic reversals owe to strategic miscalculations—the strategy was not sufficiently perceptive, imaginative, or visionary. Alternatively, it was too much of a good thing. But the truth is that strategic reversals are quite commonly failures of execution. In many cases, a strategy is abandoned out of impatience or because of pressure for an instant payoff before it has had a chance to take root and yield results. Or, its focal point is allowed to drift over time.\nTo draw a strategy is relatively easy but to execute it is difficult. Strategy is both a macro and a micro phenomenon that depends on synchronization. For that reason, it is worthwhile to examine a few elements of a disciplined process for systematically reviewing, evaluating, prioritizing, sequencing, managing, redirecting, and, if necessary,even canceling strategic initiatives",

    "abstract": "Using interview-based 'insider case study' research, this paper outlines why the University of Salford has adopted a Learning Technologies Strategy and examines the factors which are likely to lead to its successful implementation. External reasons for the adoption focused on the need to: respond to 'increased Higher Education (HE) competition', meet student expectations of learning technology use, provide more flexibility and access to the curriculum, address the possible determining effect of technology and establish a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) presence in this 'particular area of the HE landscape'. Internal drivers centred on the need to: continue a 'bottom-up' e-learning pilot project initiative, particularly given that a VLE is a 'complex tool' which requires effective strategic implementation, and promote the idea that learning technology will play an important role in determining the type of HE institution that the University of Salford wishes to become. Likely success factors highlighted the need to: create 'time and space' for innovation, maintain effective communication and consultation at all levels of the organization, emphasize the operational aspects of the strategy, establish a variety of staff development processes and recognize the negotiatory processes involved in understanding the term 'web presence' in local teaching cultures. Fundamentally, the paper argues that policy makers should acknowledge the correct 'cultural configuration' of HE institutions when seeking to manage and achieve organizational change. Thus, it is not just a question of establishing 'success factors' per se but also whether they are contextualized appropriately within a 'correct' characterization of the organizational culture",

Much of the relevant literature recognises technology as the driving force behind the fast rate of change in many markets. Consequently, organisations are becoming increasingly dependent on advanced technology to improve their performance. At the same time organisations need to be extremely flexible in order to meet the demands of customers quickly, accurately and cost-effectively. To benefit from the potential of technology in highly dynamic environments, there is a need to integrate technology strategy with business strategy. This research explores the integration between technology strategy and business strategy in the airline industry.\r\nThe literature on technology, technology strategy, corporate strategy, business strategy, competitive advantage and the integration of technology strategy with business strategy is critically evaluated and shortcomings of the literature are identified. The literature review was evaluated and identifies gaps and possible future directions. This indicated a need for a systematic way of linking technology and business strategies. Thus an Integration Model is proposed consisting of three stages involving business strategy, competitive strategy and technology strategy.

They enable to\nexpress the capacities of agents in a system to ensure the satisfaction of\ntemporal properties. Particularly, SL and ATLsc enable several agents to\ninteract in a context mixing the different strategies they play in a semantical\ngame. We generalize this possibility by proposing a new formalism, Updating\nStrategy Logic (USL). In USL, an agent can also refine its own strategy. The\ngain in expressive power rises the notion of \"sustainable capacities\" for\nagents.\n  USL is built from SL. It mainly brings to SL the two following modifications:\nsemantically, the successor of a given state is not uniquely determined by the\ndata of one choice from each agent. Syntactically, we introduce in the language\nan operator, called an \"unbinder\", which explicitely deletes the binding of a\nstrategy to an agent.

    "summary": "This paper investigates whether strategy workshops can produce strategic change, addressing a gap in understanding the sources of such change. Using empirical data from 99 workshops across ten organizations, the study found that workshops can indeed effect change, but sequential workshops are significantly more effective than one-off events. Key factors influencing success include the elapsed duration and frequency of workshops, the scope and autonomy of the involved unit, and the seniority of participants. This research contributes to the conceptualization of strategic change by highlighting the mechanisms through which workshops can drive organizational transformation."

It proposes a shift from mass marketing to targeted segmentation and consumer-led dialogue, drawing on concepts from Olvin Tofle and Frederick Raykhheld. The strategy involves delivering textbooks in parts (e.g., sections, modules) over time, paid for incrementally. This approach aims to provide publishers with guaranteed income and real-time insights into consumer needs, while offering students cost savings and relevant educational materials. It emphasizes relational marketing and requires detailed segment investigation and analysis of publisher capacities."

As this logic\nnaturally captures multi-player games with imperfect information, the problem\nturns out to be undecidable. We introduce a syntactical class of \"hierarchical\ninstances\" for which, intuitively, as one goes down the syntactic tree of the\nformula, strategy quantifications are concerned with finer observations of the\nmodel. We prove that model-checking SLii restricted to hierarchical instances\nis decidable. This result, because it allows for complex patterns of\nexistential and universal quantification on strategies, greatly generalises\nprevious ones, such as decidability of multi-player games with imperfect\ninformation and hierarchical observations, and decidability of distributed\nsynthesis for hierarchical systems. To establish the decidability result, we\nintroduce and study QCTL*ii, an extension of QCTL* (itself an extension of CTL*\nwith second-order quantification over atomic propositions) by parameterising\nits quantifiers with observations. The simple syntax of QCTL* ii allows us to\nprovide a conceptually neat reduction of SLii to QCTL*ii that separates\nconcerns, allowing one to forget about strategies and players and focus solely\non second-order quantification. While the model-checking problem of QCTL*ii is,\nin general, undecidable, we identify a syntactic fragment of hierarchical\nformulas and prove, using an automata-theoretic approach, that it is decidable.\nThe decidability result for SLii follows since the reduction maps hierarchical\ninstances of SLii to hierarchical formulas of QCTL*ii ",

    "abstract": "Using transaction cost theory, considerable research in marketing has focused on the conditions under which firms would use direct or vertically integrated versus indirect or arms length channels of distribution. Data from the field, however, indicate that channel configurations are more varied and complex, with multiple channels and composite channels being just as common as direct and indirect channels. In an attempt to explain this variety, this paper revisits the influence on channel structure of another contending variable, namely environmental complexity. We explore the role and influence of its two components, namely volatility (stability) and heterogeneity (homogeneity). Our study of 139 firms in the healthcare industry reveals that firms facing highly volatile and customer concentrated environments tend to use direct channels, and firms facing highly stable and heterogeneous environments tend to use distribution channels. Intermediate forms such as composite channels and multiple channels were favored by firms facing combinations of the environment where the intensity of one component was high and the other low. In general, firms seem to first choose a business strategy to address their external environment, and then choose a channel strategy to support that business strategy. Firms did not always adapt by making structural changes. Under certain conditions, they simply reallocated channel functions within the same structure, thus virtually deriving all the benefits of a new structure without having to create one.marketing; channels of distribution;",

    "abstract": "Game theory is usually considered applied mathematics, but a few\ngame-theoretic results, such as Borel determinacy, were developed by\nmathematicians for mathematics in a broad sense. These results usually state\ndeterminacy, i.e. the existence of a winning strategy in games that involve two\nplayers and two outcomes saying who wins. In a multi-outcome setting, the\nnotion of winning strategy is irrelevant yet usually replaced faithfully with\nthe notion of (pure) Nash equilibrium. This article shows that every\ndeterminacy result over an arbitrary game structure, e.g. a tree, is\ntransferable into existence of multi-outcome (pure) Nash equilibrium over the\nsame game structure. The equilibrium-transfer theorem requires cardinal or\norder-theoretic conditions on the strategy sets and the preferences,\nrespectively, whereas counter-examples show that every requirement is relevant,\nalbeit possibly improvable. When the outcomes are finitely many, the proof\nprovides an algorithm computing a Nash equilibrium without significant\ncomplexity loss compared to the two-outcome case.

    "abstract": "Kenya has undertaken much work to date on data and knowledge issues, and has advanced this through the Kenya Data Forum—a national initiative managed by the Deputy President's office that aims to develop and implement a long term sustainable local data strategy. Kenya, however, lacks an organized framework for collecting reliable and comparable data on philanthropy in the country; to help meet this need, the Philanthropy Sector in Kenya has come together over the decades through the creation of the East Africa Association of Grantmakers (EAAG) and more recently the Kenya Philanthropy Forum (KPF) and its Data Sub-group. In June 2015 the KPF organized a Philanthropy Data Management convening that brought together over 30 foundations and trusts to explore opportunities for strengthening data collection, management, and sharing data in the philanthropy forum for greater impact and influence on national development efforts in Kenya. As a result, certain outcomes and aspirations were agreed upon. They included:Establishing the principles for data management for philanthropy.Expanding the forum so that participation reflects the size and diversity of existing forms of philanthropy.Developing a standardized tool for data collection.Actively engaging in the existing philanthropy data initiative.Partnering with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) to establish data sets that effectively capture the contribution of philanthropy in Kenya's development.The June 2015 meeting highlighted the urgent need for philanthropic data and that \"Kenya lacks an organized framework for collecting reliable and comparable data on philanthropy in the country.\" To begin systematically addressing these recommendations, Foundation Center (a philanthropic support organisation based in New York) designed a multi-stage Data Strategy and Capacity Building Program, working in partnership with KPF, EAAG, Kenya Community Development Foundation (KCDF), and the Sustainable Development Goals Philanthropy Platform (SDGPP). This initiative was kicked off at a special \"Data Scoping Meeting\" of the KPF on 28 April 2016, attended by a total of 51 participants representing across section of Kenyan foundations, trusts, and support organisations. As reflected in the meeting agenda (see Appendix A), the objectives of the Data Scoping Meeting were as follows:1. Establish principles for collaborative data and knowledge management2. Understand the core data needs of philanthropy in Kenya3. Leverage available technologies for collecting and sharing data and knowledge4. Leverage global knowledge for local purposes5.

    "abstract": "Manufacturing companies should create maintenance strategy and link it to the manufacturing and business goals but recent research in the North East of England suggested that few companies do this. It is unclear why this inertia existed but it could have been due to the complexity and variety of the advice on offer in relation to the formulation and implementation of strategy. The purpose of this paper was to provide a simple generic guide or roadmap for practitioners to follow. It began by highlighting the importance and benefits of a maintenance strategy and then considered literature appropriate to the topic. A key point arising from this review was that the three elements; process, content, context, need to be considered over the lifecycle of a strategy. Moreover, most strategic models converged to simple sequential models affording a generic functional process to be developed. This involved the integration of the “corporate hard systems” model and the “Plan, do, check, act, cycle“, forming a suitable maintenance strategy process. Accordingly, further guidance on policy assured the right “content”. The paper concluded with a short questionnaire used to audit the effect of “contextual factors” on maintenance strategy. The result was a comprehensive guide on how to formulate and implement maintenance strategy",

The methodology, consistent with prior OECD indicators, categorizes restrictions into foreign ownership limitations, screening/notification procedures, and management/operational constraints. The FDI restrictiveness indicator specifically quantifies statutory deviations from national treatment, highlighting discrimination against foreign investment. This indicator, when integrated with other influencing factors, demonstrates strong predictive power for a country's inward FDI performance, making it a valuable tool for economic analysis and policy formulation related to international investment flows."

    "abstract": "Stratification economics represents an important new approach devoted to explaining economic inequality in terms of how social groups are separated or stratified along economic lines. This paper combines stratification economics with identity economics to address complications that the phenomenon of intersectionality – people having multiple social group identities – creates for stratification economics. It distinguishes two types of social identities recognized by social psychologists, categorical and relational social identities, and uses this distinction to explain how individuals’ personal identities, understood as ordered sets of social identities, can be seen to be both socially and self-constructed. Individuals order and rank their categorical social identities according to weights they assign to them in interactive social settings in which their role-based relational social identities combine different categorical social identities. Recent research in social psychology in the stigma identity threat literature is then reviewed to distinguish two different ways in which individuals respond to others’ stigmatization of their social groups in interactive settings. The paper argues that individuals respond to stigma by assigning weights to their categorical social group identities in ways that reflect both functional power relationships and stigmatization in a way that on balance tend to reinforce social stratification",

In Chapter XIV we saw how, at the end of the century, Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) attempted to reformulate classical theory to bring it up to date. He was aware of the criticism that what the classicists had produced was a science of wealth which was not at all a science of welfare.

    "abstract": "What triggers extreme exchange-rate returns? Though news is the source of volatility in standard theoretical models, in reality volatility is often unrelated to news. This paper shows that extreme exchange-rate returns -- and, more generally, high kurtosis of returns -- are statistically inevitable even in the absence of news. We identify four microstructural sources of return kurtosis in price-contingent order flow: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of price-contingent order sizes; (2) clustering of price-contingent order executions at certain times of day; (3) clustering of order executions at certain price levels; and (4) the tendency of positive-feedback trading to propagate trends. Using simulations calibrated to price-contingent orders placed at a major foreign exchange dealing bank we show that when each factor operates in isolation, the one that contributes most to kurtosis in returns is kurtosis in the order-size distribution. When the factors operate simultaneously, however, their interactions prove far more important. Extreme returns in the absence of news should be viewed as natural rather than anomalous.kurtosis, exchange rates, order flow, high-frequency, microstructure, jump process, value-atrisk, risk management",

Thus, the outcome of the cartel-fringe open-loop equilibrium can be supported as an outcome of a subgame perfect equilibrium. However the interpretation of the cartel-fringe model, where from the outset the fringe is assumed to be price taker, as a limit case of an asymmetric oligopoly with the agents playing Nash-Cournot, does not extend to the case where firms can use closed-loop strategies.",

We argue that ICBT must be understood in light of two features of West African national boundaries: divergent economic policies between neighboring countries and the ease with which informal operators can ship goods across borders. We focus on two ICBT clusters: Senegal–The Gambia and Nigeria–Benin–Togo. Nigeria and Senegal have protected their domestic industries with high import barriers, whereas Benin, Togo and The Gambia have maintained lower import taxation. These differential trade policies, together with high mobility of goods and people across borders, lead to widespread smuggling, with goods imported legally in low-tax countries and re-exported unofficially to countries with higher import duties",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the prevalence of informal cross-border trade (ICBT) in West Africa, despite regional integration efforts. The authors argue that ICBT is driven by divergent economic policies, specifically import barriers, between neighboring countries and the ease of cross-border movement for goods and people. Focusing on the Senegal\nThe Gambia and Nigeria\nBenin\nTogo clusters, the study reveals widespread smuggling where goods are legally imported into low-tax countries and unofficially re-exported to higher-tax nations. This research offers insights into trade policies, informal economies, and economic disparities in West Africa."

    "abstract": "The current crisis is leading many to re-think the role of finance and how it snew. This paper reviews what was regarded as the conventional wisdom on financial regulation prior to the 2007 onset of the crisis, briefly recounts some of the main factors behind the events of the 2007-09 years, and then turns to lessons for regulatory reform. At some point in the 1990s, the financial systems of high-income countries seemed to be functioning well and withstood some significant shocks, yet by 2007 much had changed. However, the regulatory structure did not change in response, and in fact eased in such a way as to exacerbate the instability that was subsequently experienced. A key theme is that financial regulation needs to be more dynamic, taking account of financial innovations and how they affect the sector. No such approach to regulation seems possible without greater accountability for regulators and attention to the incentives for those in the sector and for those who regulate it.Financial crisis, Securitization, Regulation and Supervision, Safety Nets",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the adequacy of post-reform growth in Latin America in the 1990s on the basis of international comparisons as well as historical and other relevant standards, analytically exploring and empirically testing a number of hypotheses to explain the perceived dissatisfaction with growth performance in the region. We find that there is no Â“growth puzzleÂ” in Latin America. Growth has not been higher in the post-reform period not because of a failure of reforms to yield the growth payoff that they should have been expected to do on the basis of international experience, but because of the combination of an unfavorable external environment with insufficient depth and breadth of reform. We also estimate the long-run growth payoff of macroeconomic reforms, the additional gains that can be achieved by deepening this first generation of reforms, and the potential payoff from broadening the scope of reform into a second generation of reforms encompassing deeper structural and institutional areas.",

Moreover, institutions of public higher education, where almost two-thirds of the full-time faculty members at four-year institutions are employed, are under severe financial pressure. The share of state budgets devoted to public higher education is declining. The salaries of economics department faculty members at public higher education institutions have fallen substantially relative to the salaries of their counterparts at private higher education institutions and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the publics to compete for top faculty in economics. Moreover, it is at the economics departments in public institutions where the greatest increase in the usage of non-tenure track faculty has also occurred.

    "title": "Professionalisation of Australian Agricultural Economics: 1920 - 1970",
    "abstract": "Australian agricultural economics was on the verge of professional recognition at the beginning of the 1950s. The discipline had emerged from the Second World War in a strong position due primarily to the work of the State Departments of Agriculture, the Economics Departments of the banks, and the pioneering efforts of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Agricultural economics as a field of study was being taken up by economics and agricultural science students alike, and research projects in agricultural economics were burgeoning. This paper investigates the factors which contributed to the professionalisation of agricultural economics in Australia after the Second World War. All vocations aspire to professional status but, even when it does receive professional recognition, a vocation is often still questioned regarding the legitimacy of that status. It is therefore significant to explore the origins and evolution of the agricultural economics profession in order to discover the reasons why it came into existence and the process by which the professionalisation occurred. The changed economic environment during and after the Second World War meant that agricultural economists were given opportunities to present a convincing case to pursue the professionalisation of their discipline. The distinguishing and overruling characteristic of a profession is the possession of specialized knowledge which has been acquired as a result of prolonged training. The knowledge is intellectual and based on the exploration of a recognized field of study. The way in which this knowledge is obtained is an important part of the professionalisation process. This paper identifies the economists and scientists who established the discipline of agricultural economics in Australian universities and set it on the path to professionalisation. The second most important aspect of professionalisation is the formation of a professional society for members and the development of a professional journal to disseminate research and other general information to members. The formation of the professional organisation associated with agricultural economics in Australia is examined in this paper. Australian agricultural economics was at the peak of its influence in the 1970s. All the mainland universities had at least one professor of agricultural economics, there was a strong professional association, annual conferences, and bi-annual outlook conferences, and three separate professional journals were in publication. The value of the agricultural economics profession was widely accepted throughout the policy community.Teaching/Communication/Extension/Profession,",

    "abstract": "This paper is a prepublication version of a submission to the International Review of Economics Education. It outlines a code of conduct for economics, in the form of a pluralist benchmark for Quality Assurance in economics education. This is a necessary corrective to the publicly-recognised failure of economics in the face of the 2008 crisis, which Colander et al (2009 term its “systemic failure”. This systemic failure is analysed as a consequence of the regulatory capture of the academic profession of economics, arising from and institutionalised by its present peer ranking procedures. Pluralism is the necessary antidote. It affords two decisive benefits: it produces good economics and better economists. The paper is part of a broad consultation on teaching in economics, organised by the UK-based Association for Heterodox Economists (AHE). It argues that a pluralist subject benchmark, derived from a pluralist code of conduct, is a prerequisite for the reform of the profession. Critical, pluralistic and independent thinking should be the primary requirement good economic practice, and pecific provisions should be made to recognise, promote, defend and guarantee this good practice in teaching and assessment alike. Systemic failure requires a systemic solution. The paper explains how the built-in tendency of the economic profession to select for conformity has led to its regulatory capture. Existing UK benchmarks have substituted peer-ranking – the appointment of judges selected for comformity – for collaborative peer review – the pluralistic integration of the strengths of the academic community. This past practice has become institutionalised at every level. The profoundly non-scientific practice of simply reproducing a politically acceptable consensus has thereby replaced the independent and critical pursuit of knowledge as the primary peer-recognised hallmark of quality. Tomorrow’s economists need to be defended against the systemic failure of the economics of today. This requires a conscious regulatory intervention – benchmarking for pluralism.Economics Teaching, Pluralism, Heterodox Economics",

    "abstract": "Elementary economics textbooks have become less attractive to students requiring only an introduction to economics, given that their content is pervaded by mathematical diagrams and simple equations. Also they are of relatively little value to those interested in, for example, attempting to gain an understanding of the New Economy, for they rarely emphasise business innovation and its crucial dynamic role. These factors engender something of a double paradox. First (paradox of the tools and the audience), newcomers are frequently 'turned off' by existing economics textbooks due to the pervasive use of mathematics. Second (paradox of the content and relevance), those newcomers who are not initially turned off tend to be disenchanted with economics because they perceive that economics is of little use in understanding the New Economy in which they work, or will come to work. We suggest an integrated solution to both paradoxes. The implementation entails a minor reorientation of the traditional pedagogical strategy for teaching introductory economics.Double paradox, elementary economics education",

Facing over-exploitation and natural disaster, federal management aimed to curb declining biomass and over-capitalization. Initial limited entry, including vessel moratoriums and catch quotas, proved insufficient to address inefficiency caused by increasing vessel sizes and fishing gear. The subsequent ITQ system, implemented from 1990, allowed market mechanisms to reduce capital utilization and enhance economic efficiency. Within two years, the fleet size decreased by 54%, and vessel capacity utilization and productivity significantly improved, generating $11.4 million in resource rent for vessel owners by 1992. The study highlights the effectiveness of ITQs in achieving economic efficiency and sustainable resource management."

In 2008 some 20 per cent of bovines slaughtered in the EU were for veal production and\n\nabout one-third of them were dairy calves. France, the Netherlands and Italy were Europe’s leading producers. Veal consumption in the European Union has been in steady decline since 1970. In 2008, it averaged 1.6 kg per capita,\n\nwith France and Italy being the largest consumers. Despite variations in farming systems and carcass characteristics from one country to another, veal production is an important outlet for milk replacer producers and provides\n\na market for their industrial dairy products. Regular changes in production factors such as the price of 8-day-old calves and milk replacers and their availability engender recurrent output fluctuations. Veal calf production\n\nplays a major part in regulating the milk and bovine-meat markets: it has largely contributed to stemming dairy (and sometimes meat) surpluses. However, the context has changed since 2008 with no more surplus milk supply and reduced EU-support for incorporating skimmed milk powder into milk feeds. Therefore, the relative attractiveness of other productions using 8-day-old calves and the support policies for cattle farming as a whole will affect the future of the veal calf industry",

    "abstract": "While few people now believe that nuclear power would provide ‘power too cheap to meter’, there is still a common perception that nuclear power is a cheap source of electricity. The fact that nuclear power has not come to dominate electricity generation is seen as being due to a combination of public opposition and dealing with the safety issues raised by accidents such as those at Three Mile Island (1978), Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011). The reality is that nuclear power has seldom been the cheapest option for new power stations. Worse, the real cost of any normal successful technology goes down over time due to the effect of intuitively sensible factors such as ‘learning-by-doing’, economies of scale and general technical progress. For nuclear power, these factors do not seem to have worked and for its entire commercial history, the real cost of nuclear power has only ever gone upwards. The Fukushima disaster can only give a further twist to this upward spiral. This paper examines the determinants of the cost of a kilowatt hour (kWh) of nuclear electricity; what the latest designs of nuclear power plant can offer; how new nuclear plants might be financed; and what issues will determine whether South Africa can successfully launch a new nuclear programme",

The research challenges the prevailing assumption that teaching is merely a presentational issue, abstracting it from content. Keywords: economics education, pluralism, learning strategies, teaching reform, monist approach."

    "summary": "This paper investigates the anatomy of stigmatized behavior, focusing on peer influence and relative concern beyond mere poverty. It highlights that even among the poor, not everyone engages in stigmatized activities, suggesting other underlying factors. The research explores how concern for social status shapes such behaviors, especially when the consequences of falling behind are severe. The study utilizes a household survey and gift network data to define reference groups and measure relative deprivation using various indices, including Wildman and Deaton's. It also employs three strategies for identifying peer effects on behaviors like blood donation, using instrumental variables and spatial instruments derived from network structures."

    "abstract": "In the wake of the economic crisis, a number of student organizations and researchers highlighted the lack of pluralism and heterodox approaches in economics curricula. The relevance of pluralism becomes clear once set within the implications of a given scientific discourse on reality (e.g. economics and policy making). This study explores the role of instructors in co-constructing the pluralism discourse and debates, while recognizing the role of institutional obstacles to change within the discipline. An empirical field study is conducted with lecturers in introductory economics courses at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business where they place themselves within the pluralism discourse via a Q-study - a mixed method employed for studying subjectivity in socially contested topics. In Q, a set of statements undergo a sorting procedure on a relative ranking scale, followed by factor-rendering. Four voices are identified: Moderate Pluralist, Mainstreamers, Responsible Pluralists, and Applied Pluralists. The implications of their ideas are discussed from the viewpoint of discursive institutionalism, stressing the role of ideas and discourse in institutional change. Although a discursive readiness for changes towards more pluralism is claimed, strategies for overcoming the difficulties on the institutional level need to be developed",

    "abstract": "Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School of Economics, had the ambition that economics should be a .map of the forces at workÿ. Standard textbook economics (.neo-classical economicsÿ) takes as its starting point a metaphor of .equilibriumÿ based on the state of the physics profession in the 1880s. This force towards equilibrium is, however, only one of many forces at work. The most fundamental feature of capitalism is change, and this change is only poorly reflected in standard economics. Financial crises are just one of the many things that happen in real life, but cannot happen in standard textbook economics. From the standpoint of Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883-1950), Austrian economist and Harvard economics professor who spent much time at Harvard Business School, .equilibriumÿ is the opposite of economic development. Equilibrium theory therefore fails to reflect many of the mechanisms of industrial and economic dynamics that create economic welfare. This note attempts to outline some of these forces.",

    "abstract": "Networks such as ethnic credit associations, close-knit residential neighborhoods, 'old boy' networks, and ethnically linked businesses play an important role in economic life but have been little studied by economists. These networks are often supported by cultural distinctions between insiders and outsiders and engage in exclusionary practices which we call parochialism. We provide an economic analysis of parochial networks in which the losses incurred by not trading with outsiders are offset by an enhanced ability to enforce informal contracts by fostering trust among insiders. We first model one-shot social interactions among self-regarding agents, demonstrating that trust (i.e., cooperating without using information about one's trading partner) is a best response in a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium if the quality of information about one's partner is sufficiently high. We show that since larger networks have lower quality information about specific individuals and greater trading opportunities, there may be an optimal (payoff-maximizing) network size. We then model the growth and decline of networks, as well as their equilibrium size and number. We show that in the absence of parochialism, networks may not exist, and the appropriate level of parochialism may implement an optimal network size. Finally, we explore the welfare implications and reasons for the evolutionary success of exclusion on parochial and other grounds.",
