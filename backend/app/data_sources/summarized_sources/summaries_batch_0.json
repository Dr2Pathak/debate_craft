The text emphasizes that adherence to Christian principles in the post-war era will lead to a God-fearing society, contrasting it with a \"might makes right\" barbarianism.

    "title": "Conrad and the First World War",
    "abstract": "During the First World War, Conrad believed himself peripheral to a transitional historical moment. In November 1914, he wrote: 'the thoughts of this war sit on one's chest like a nightmare. I am painfully aware of being crippled, of being idle, of being useless with a sort of absurd anxiety' (CL 5, 427). In August 1915, Conrad felt the 'world of 15 years ago is gone to pieces; what will come in its place God knows, but I imagine doesn't care' (CL 5, 503). The political forces of nineteenth-century Europe that had fashioned Conrad's literature, notably imperialism and nationalism, were undermined and unleashed anew by the violence of the Great War and the uncertain legacy of the conflict. Conrad closely observed Poland's fate throughout the war in his relationship with Polish activist Józef Retinger, which inspired 'A Note on the Polish Problem' (1916) and 'The Crime of Partition' (1919). While 1918 saw the political rebirth of Poland, antagonisms provoked by the redrawing of Europe's historical boundaries made Conrad uneasy. On Armistice Day, he wrote: 'The great sacrifice is consummated - and what will come of it to the nations of the earth the future will show. I can not confess to an easy mind. Great and very blind forces are set free catastrophically all over the world' (CL 6, 302)",

    "abstract": "The history of Canada’s soldiers in the twentieth century tends to incorporate a few recurrent themes. One of these is the changing nature of the soldier’s experience of war, from the Boer War through to the Second World War and beyond. Another is the gradual transition of Canadian military forces from British to American spheres of influence, a theme that has become particularly relevant since 1939. This article will explore these two themes from a material history perspective, an approach that is generally absent from the broader historiography. The focus will be the transformations in the Canadian infantry soldier’s personal field equipment and kit from the Second World War through to the 1980s. The evidence from this period points to two conclusions: first, that the experience of war and the growing professionalism of the Canadian infantryman has been reflected in his equipment; and second, that there has been an American influence on the equipment of the Canadian soldier since the outbreak of the Second World War",

Using two distinctly different, yet complementary, autobiographies – those of army band musician Frank Mathias and composer Gunther Schuller – the functions and impacts of both popular and art music on the American war effort will be analyzed and compared. Their stories will then be contextualized within the larger narrative of twentieth century American music, showcasing how World War II – through the increased influence of jazz – shaped the evolution of both popular and art music in the United States during the early 1940s",

After a loss of funding, venereal disease became unattended until 1936 when Thomas Parran was appointed as Surgeon General. He made prevention of venereal disease his top priority and began a new campaign, determined to make it more effective and better funding than its predecessor. The subsequent advent of World War II strengthened national interest. With the inspiration of Parran, the Public Health Service and other organizations made movies, posters, pamphlets, books, and school curriculums. Despite these efforts beginning before the war and only intensifying during the war years, venereal disease rates during World War II climbed through 1943. However, in contrast to the first campaign, Parran’s attempt to end venereal diseases was better funded and longer lasting than its predecessor",

Jonathan Vance’s award-winning Death So Noble: Memory, Meaning and the First World War (1997) does a marvelous job of surveying attitudes towards war in the wake of the Great War, but it does not expand into the start of the Second. C.P. Stacey’s official history, Six Years of War, devotes only minimal space to exploring the transition, focusing instead on the activities of Canadian servicemen and women. The dozens of militia histories written by the units after the war dwell on the fighting, not the training.\nAfter telling of the story of Toronto’s experience of the first months of the Second World War, it is possible to reflect on why events unfolded as they did. Community reaction to the transformation of Toronto’s militia force into Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) units provides a window into the world of late August and early September 1939. Through what process did this body of militia men transform themselves into the backbone of First Canadian Army? How many of them volunteered to serve the Empire in the second continental European war in a generation?

    "abstract": "Long after the guns of the First World War went silent on 11 November 1918, the war continues to spark debate. The many points of contention were on full display at the “From Memory to History” conference, hosted by Western University in London, Ontario, over three days in November 2011. Scholars and enthusiasts from around the world gathered to share, debate, and ultimately demonstrate that the war’s many legacies are still open to interpretation, even as the centenary of the war’s outbreak approaches. Perhaps the most crucial lesson learned is that both memory and history are malleable concepts, prone to revision, and there are numerous narratives in many disciplines that remain untold, even with an event as well-documented as the First World War",

    "abstract": "Jay Winter delivered the following in the form of a lecture at the Canadian War Museum on 31 October 2000. A distinguished academic, Winter has been writing about the cultural history of the First World War for nearly three decades. He has taught at the University of Cambridge in England and is presently at Yale University. Since 1988, he has been a director of the Historial de la grande guerre in Peronne, an important war museum in northern France. In this capacity, he has become familiar with a great many institutions of war and military history around the world and he has great knowledge and familiarity with the important historical and intellectual debates that will be fundamental to the creation of a new Canadian War Museum, which is now slated to open in May 2005.\nProbably Winter’s best-known book is Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: the Great War in European Cultural History published in 1995. In it, he argues that the rituals of mourning associated with commemoration after the First World War had a history stretching far back in human life and experience. In this he contradicts the thinking of Canadian historian Modris Eksteins who argued that the Great War marked the birth of the modern age. Lately, Daniel Sherman has proposed that commemorative ceremonies and memorials are significantly politicized in the interests of state control. In the following paper Winter warns against the dangers of collective memory being collapsed into “a set of stories formed by or about the state” while also providing a rich overview of the great importance that attention to memory and culture studies has taken on in contemporary thought. These cannot be ignored in any serious attempt to lay the intellectual foundation of any new museum, and perhaps especially may have specific relevance to a new war museum",

    "abstract": "Very little has been written about the Canadian Army Film Unit (CAFU) since the end of the Second World War, despite Jon Farrell’s postulation. There have been a few short newspaper articles related to teh Film Unit and the D-Day footage that made it famous, but there has been no scholarly study by either military or film historians. The purpose of the CAFU was to create an official audio-visual record of Canada’s Army, just as the official historians, war artists, and photographers were documenting other aspects of the war. The Film Unit started as only a few men, but expanded substantially throughout the war, increasing the scope and breadth of its productions. The men and women of the CAFU who operated the cameras, edited the film, and then distributed the finished products were different from the civilian war correspondents and commercial newsreel cameramen who were also creating a visual record of the war. The CAFU attached cameramen to military units and they shot real-time footage of Canadians in battle. This footage was then used to create the CAFU films, and formed the basis of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and commercial newsreel company productions.\nMost of the existing scholarship exploring Canadian film and the Second World War focuses on the NFB and John Grierson, the father of the documentary in Canada and the NFB’s first film commissioner. The historiography suggests that NFB was, for all practical purposes, the main film institution creating Canadian motion pictures. This was true, but much of its wartime film footage came from the cameras of the CAFU—footage that was shot in harm’s way. Despite this neglect by historians, the CAFU played an essential role in the history of Canadian film. Much of what subsequent generations have seen or know about the Second World War comes from footage shot by the Film Unit. Yet it is a difficult story to tell since it must be pieced together using primary sources, both textual and audio-visual. The Film Unit will receive the credit that it deserves and will find its place again in the history of the Second World War",

    "summary": "This article examines John Alfred Terraine, a highly influential and controversial British military historian of the First World War. It explores how Terraine challenged mainstream theories, defended generals, and debunked myths about the British Expeditionary Force through his nine books. His work aimed to bring balance and new perspective to historical arguments surrounding Britain's contribution to the conflict, earning him both notoriety and significant influence among scholars and analysts, particularly during the 1960s boom in WWI scholarship."

    "abstract": "Turning now from the immediate diplomatic aftermath of World War I, let us examine some major features of Western Civilization during what has been called the long weekend, the two decades between that war and World War II (1919-1939). We will note first the way in which the West generated within itself economic stresses, local and general, which prevented it from realizing the tremendous potential created by continuing technological advances. Then we will note how these economic changes were paralleled by changes in social organization and attitudes. We will see these new attitudes in conflict with each other and with survivals from earlier ages. This will be illustrated in greater detail in three sections in which the democracies and their chief competitors are studied. All the above topics will deal with aspects of the civil wars — military and otherwise — which are one of the features of Western Civilization. This stands out sharply in the next section on the shifting balance of military power in the West and the road to World War II. At this point we will note the increasing impact of the non-Western world. [excerpt",

    "abstract": "Made up of women and the men who could not join the military, the home front was more than just victory gardens and factory jobs. Although factory work was seen as a way for women both to help the war effort and at the same time gain some independence outside the home, not every woman was ready to hang up her dress and start donning pants full time. There was a middle ground where women were able to break traditional feminine roles yet still keep their dresses and serve the servicemen fighting the war between victory gardens and factory jobs; a balance was found in volunteer organizations designed to serve the military. The largest and most well-known organization on the home front was the United Services Organization, more commonly referred to as the USO. After the outbreak of World War II, USO canteens start to appear everywhere across the United States in towns and cities alike. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was one of many towns with their own USO branch. The Gettysburg branch was supported by the female students at Gettysburg College and the Army Air Corps detachment stationed on campus which provided an opportunity for local young women to explore new social roles while supporting the war effort.

The purpose is to explain the reasons for this significant downturn. Key methods involve analyzing historical trends of world trade relative to GDP and identifying contributing factors. Main findings indicate that the decline is primarily due to the current global recession, which causes a fall in demand for traded goods, and disruptions in financial markets, leading to reduced credit for international trade. Global supply chains and potential protectionism are also discussed as contributing issues."

It argues that the conflict in Asia, including the Sino-Japanese War and Japanese occupations of Southeast Asia, represented crucial mid-20th-century developments beyond the Allies versus Axis framework. By analyzing the intersection of Japanese imperialism with local nationalisms and its ideological adjustments towards a \"post-colonial\" world, the study reveals how these events foreshadowed broader global shifts, particularly in the \"Third World.\" The author contends that centering the war narrative on Asia offers greater insight into 20th-century global history than a focus solely on Europe."

    "abstract": "During the German occupation of Northern Italy (1943-45), the Italian populace lived under the grip of fear as Allied bombardments pummeled towns, Nazifascists raided villages looking for partisans, and food grew ever more scarce. When night fell many Italians had to contend with another menace, a mysterious aircraft that they were sure was specifically after them and their loved ones. So real and yet mysterious was this aircraft that they gave it a name: Pippo. No one was quite sure if it was German or Allied, single-engine or double-engine, if it dropped bombs, or what its primary mission was, but Pippo loomed as a nocturnal specter, instilling order and terror in the Italian towns below. Scant official documentation exists on Pippo, and references in literature are even scarcer. But Pippo lives in the popular memory of the World War II generation. In 1990 RAI Tre sponsored a television series called La mia guerra [My war] and invited Italians to send in letters documenting their memories; in these testimonials Pippo comes to life. Perry\\u27s essay integrates oral histories of both Italian civilians and former American night fighter pilots, an analysis of over a hundred letters sent to the RAI Tre commission sponsoring La mia guerra, and a study of German propaganda. Finally, it weaves official U.S. Army Air Corps documents into the inquiry. All venues of analysis shed light on how Pippo served many Italians as a means to concretize their fears",

    "title": "World War II: On the Home Front - M. Francis Coulson Interview",
    "abstract": "Americans love anniversaries. The fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War has afforded citizens an opportunity to remember with pride the great men and events of a war that saved the world from totalitarian tyranny. Happily, memories of World War II have not been restricted to recalling battlefield heroics or diplomatic intrigues. Across the United States, public libraries and local historical societies have commemorated the Home Front during the war years with exhibits that recapture the texture of life on farms, factories, in classrooms, and at home during what Studs Terkel has labeled  the Good War.  These exhibits remind us what we know instinctively: that experiencing wartime is not simply the province of men and women in uniform. Anyone over the age of fifty-five has some vivid memories of America at war from 1941-1945. Millions of Americans who never put on a military uniform made their own contributions to the war effort. Their contributions mattered, and so do their memories.\nAt Gettysburg College, in recognition of this basic truth, students in Historical Methods courses have for several years been interviewing senior citizens about their wartime memories. Perhaps two dozen or more of these interviews were conducted with Adams countians, across a broad spectrum of experience. Among the interview subjects were farmers, housewives, nurses, schoolteachers, businessmen, college students, and seminarians. One subject, a conscientious objector, provided a most distinctive perspective on a war that mythology suggests was supported fervently by all Americans.\nIn fact, most Americans did enthusiastically support the war effort, as testimony from Adams Countians suggests. In the following interview, conducted by Gettysburg College student Jenny Sonnenberg with Francis Coulson, readers will learn some of the ways that average citizens were affected by the war and contributed to a remarkable home-front effort to support the boys overseas. A teacher in a one-room school in the county for much of the war, Mr. Coulson recounts his experiences with rationing and civil defense, and offers a persuasive picture of a populace that was willing to make sacrifices in order to help American soldiers bring the war to a quicker end. It is an important story, not because Francis Coulson\\u27s experiences were spectacular, much less unique, but rather, because they were commonplace. As the interview itself suggests, the war years marked a time when Americans had much less materially than they would in the boom times following the war. It was still a time of simple habits and old fashioned values. In bringing to life the experiences of these years and the habits of everyday life, oral histories like those Ms. Sonnenberg conducted with Francis Coulson make an important contribution to local history and can help spark other conversations with individuals who had their own distinctive experiences during the war years. What follows is an edited transcription of a taped interview that is available in its entirety at the Adams County Historical Society Library. [excerpt",

    "abstract": "This thesis examines the tactics employed by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles (NZMR) Brigade during the Sinai Palestine Campaign of World War I. It seeks to determine how the Boer War shaped mounted rifles tactical doctrine prior to World War I, what tactics were employed during the Sinai Palestine campaign itself, and how the tactics evolved over the course of the campaign. It begins by tracing the New Zealand experience in the Boer War, the ensuing development of mounted rifles tactical doctrine and the formation of yeomanry and mounted rifles units immediately prior to World War I. The thesis follows the campaign in Sinai and Palestine, focusing primarily on patrolling operations and attacks, from the re-building of the NZMR Brigade after its return to Egypt from Gallipoli in December 1915, until the conclusion of operations at Amman in September 1918. The thesis finds that by 1914, New Zealand mounted rifles units trained to employ fire tactics, to move mounted, but to conduct attacks dismounted. New Zealanders undertook extensive mounted patrolling from the outset of the campaign. Most attacks were conducted as 'quick' attacks, despite Turkish defensive positions often being well prepared and stubbornly defended. Most attacks employed envelopment of enemy flanks and followed a general pattern of firing lines of dismounted troopers closing on the enemy under the combined weight of their own and neighbouring rifle fire, machine gun fire and artillery support. Attacks usually concluded with a bayonet charge from short range, once firing lines had got close enough to the enemy. Mounted charges were rarely undertaken, despite the spectacular success of the Australian mounted charge at Beersheba. Indeed, the New Zealand commander, General Chaytor, made a deliberate decision to continue employing dismounted tactics. The thesis finds that longevity in command appointments and the influence and experience of Boer War veterans had a positive effect on the tactics used by the NZMR Brigade",

    "abstract": "According to our interpretation, modern trade fairs started in Europe during the First World War and in its immediate aftermath. With the closing of trade movements during the war, many cities had to resort to the old medieval tradition of providing especial permits to traders to guarantee them personal protection during their trade meetings. During the tough post war crisis many more cities –typically industrial districts- discovered in the creation of trade fairs a powerful competitive tool to attract market transactions. We compare these developments with the remote origins of fairs, as, in both cases, trade fair development is a reaction to the closing of free markets under the pressure of political violence.Trade fairs, modern trade fairs, markets, industrial districts, international trade, First World War",

One of the more traditional areas of focus has been the ‘Big Three’ – the alliance of the United States with Britain and the Soviet Union. Public interest in the three leaders – Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin – remains high, and their decisions continue to resonate in the post-Cold War era, as demonstrated by continued (and often ahistorical) references to the decisions made at the Yalta Conference. Consequently, while other aspects of Second World War historiography have pushed into new avenues of exploration, that which has looked at the Grand Alliance has followed fairly conventional lines – the new Soviet bloc materials have been trawled to answer old questions and using the frames of reference that developed during the Cold War. This has left much to be said about the nature of the relationship of the United States with its great allies and the dynamics and processes of that alliance, and overlooked full and rounded analysis of the role of that alliance as the instrument of Axis defeat",

    "summary": "This review analyzes Colonel Ashton L. Kerr's \"The Cherry Beret,\" a memoir detailing his experiences as one of the first Canloan officers during World War II. The book, a personal account rather than a statistical analysis, covers Kerr's military assignments and duties, including training in North Africa and England, and participation in the invasions of Italy and Southern France, as well as the liberation of Greece and peacekeeping in Palestine. Illustrated with a hand-drawn map and photographs, it offers a humane perspective on soldier life and interactions with notable figures like Evelyn Waugh, making it a valuable historical and autobiographical resource."

The study investigates the encounters between Civil War veterans and the generation fighting the Great War, highlighting how contemporary news intertwined reports of veteran deaths with European conflict. It explores how Civil War-era terminology and attitudes, such as the term \"Sammy\" for American soldiers and the adaptation of Civil War songs, shaped early 20th-century soldiering and the American understanding of warfare. Key findings include the discovery of Civil War remains by WWI soldiers, underscoring a tangible link between past and present conflicts, and the enduring legacy of the Civil War as a lens for viewing subsequent military engagements."

    "abstract": "This paper challenges the idea that farmers revert to subsistence farming when confronted with violence from civil war. Macro-economic evidence on economic legacies of civil war suggests that civil wars, while obviously disastrous in the short run, do not need to have persistent effects on long term economic outcomes. New micro-level studies are ambiguous about the impact of civil war for welfare. Several studies find long lasting negative effects, particularly through reduced human capital formation while others for example report increased participation in collective action programs and the emergence of local institutions. We investigate to what extend individual incentives for investments are affected by civil war. Using several rounds of (panel) data at the farm and community level, we find that farmers in Burundi who are confronted with civil war violence in their home communities increase export and cash crop growing activities, invest more in public goods, and reveal higher levels of subjective welfare evaluations. We interpret this in the light of similar recent micro-level evidence that points to post-traumatic growth effects after (civil) war fare. Our results are confirmed across specifications as well as in robustness analyses",

Northerners reflected back on the theme of reconciliation, prevalent in the seventy-fifth anniversary of the war.

    "title": "Murder by Numbers: Socio-Economic Determinants of Homicide and Civil War",
    "abstract": "Deliberate killing is a common part of the defining features of both homicide and civil war. Often, the scale of killing is also similar: most countries have homicide rates that exceed the threshold of one thousand combat-related deaths during a year that is the standard criterion for civil war. What is clearly different is the organization of killing: the perpetrators of homicide are usually individuals or small groups, whereas rebellion – the direct cause of a civil war - requires a cohesive group of at least several hundred killers. Beyond this, the motivation for the two types of killing may differ systematically, although evidently both homicide and rebellion have many different motivations, including error and irrationality. In this paper we investigate whether the socio-economic determinants of homicide and civil war are similar, and then explore potential inter-relationships between them. We compare our existing model of the risk of civil war with a new model of the homicide rate. We find that there is a ‘family resemblance’ between the two types of killing, but surprising differences. Furthermore, we turn to the inter-relationships between homicide and the risk of civil war. Specifically, we ask whether a high rate of homicide makes a country more prone to civil war, and whether a civil war makes a country more prone to homicide. Our results indicate that higher homicide rate do not increase the risk of war but that civil wars generate a legacy of increased post-conflict homicide rates.",

The services provided before this had been mostly in the form of homes like the U.S. Naval Asylum in Philadelphia where veterans could receive long-term care. Many felt that homes were the best way to care for soldiers and so, in March of 1865, legislation passed to create a national asylum for disabled volunteers. On November 10, 1866, the first branch of three national homes was established. At first, the branches were open to all Union soldiers who could prove a connection between their service and their injury. They then later welcomed veterans of the War of 1812 and the Mexican War as long as they didn’t fight against the Union in the Civil War. Confederate veterans were never allowed.

These homes, such as Togus, evolved into hospitals and medical facilities, eventually leading to the creation of the Veterans Administration in 1930. They laid crucial groundwork for modern social programs."

    "abstract": "Civil war dominates conflict in the modern era. An effect of this is a large number of refugees, who flee from war-torn countries in favor of lands where they can live in safety. This paper examines the extent to which the number of these refugees is affected by the number of civil wars a country has had in a year. Previous literature suggests that civil wars increase destruction in a state and threaten people’s lives, which encourages migration out of a warring country. Based on this, this paper hypothesizes that increasing the number of civil wars in a country will likewise increase the number of refugees leaving that country. However, this explanation is not supported by this paper’s OLS model, with respect for human rights and type of government being shown as more important factors than the number of civil conflicts. A possible reason for this finding is the destruction of critical transportation infrastructure resulting from civil war. The results of this study warrant further investigation into what exactly motivates refugee behavior, especially during civil wars",

Stanley\\u27s new book, The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America is thus well timed to make an important contribution to our evolving understanding of the process of sectional reconciliation in the decades following the Civil War. With his focus on Kentucky\\u27s northern neighbors in the lower portions of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, the editorial staff of the Register of the Kentucky Historical Society believe Stanley\\u27s book will help historians better understand the role Kentucky played in the events of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, which saw a white supremacist version of Civil War memory eclipse an emancipationist version nationally.\nWe have asked four nineteenth-century historians to consider Stanley\\u27s book from varying perspectives. M. Keith Harris teaches history at a private high school in Los Angeles, California. He is the author of Across the Bloody Chasm: The Culture of Commemoration among Civil War Veterans (2014) and is currently writing a book on D. W. Griffith\\u27s controversial 1915 silent film, The Birth of a Nation. Anne E. Marshall is an associate professor of history at Mississippi State University and the author of Creating a Confederate Kentucky: The Lost Cause and Civil War Memory in a Border State (2012). James Marten is professor and chair of the history department at Marquette University. His most recent books are Sing Not War: The Lives of Union and Confederate Veterans in Gilded Age America (2011) and America\\u27s Corporal: James Tanner in War and Peace (2014). Kristopher Maulden is a visiting assistant professor of history at Columbia College in Missouri. He is completing a book manuscript on the influence of Federalist politics and federal policy in the Ohio River Valley, and he is engaged in a study of nineteenth-century Ohio newspaper editor Charles Hammond. Finally, the author of The Loyal West, Matthew E. Stanley, assistant professor of history at Albany State University, will respond to the reviews",

    "abstract": "The Civil War is the greatest trauma ever experienced by the American nation, a four-year paroxysm of violence that left in its wake more than 600,000 dead, more than 2 million refugees, and the destruction (in modern dollars) of more than $700 billion in property. The war also sparked some of the most heroic moments in American history and enshrined a galaxy of American heroes. Above all, it permanently ended the practice of slavery and proved, in an age of resurgent monarchies, that a liberal democracy could survive the most frightful of challenges.In Fateful Lightning, two-time Lincoln Prize-winning historian Allen C. Guelzo offers a marvelous portrait of the Civil War and its era, covering not only the major figures and epic battles, but also politics, religion, gender, race, diplomacy, and technology. And unlike other surveys of the Civil War era, it extends the reader\\u27s vista to include the postwar Reconstruction period and discusses the modern-day legacy of the Civil War in American literature and popular culture. Guelzo also puts the conflict in a global perspective, underscoring Americans\\u27 acute sense of the vulnerability of their republic in a world of monarchies. He examines the strategy, the tactics, and especially the logistics of the Civil War and brings the most recent historical thinking to bear on emancipation, the presidency and the war powers, the blockade and international law, and the role of intellectuals, North and South.\nWritten by a leading authority on our nation\\u27s most searing crisis, Fateful Lightning offers a vivid and original account of an event whose echoes continue with Americans to this day.

The lecture highlighted the overlooked contributions of black women unionists to the Union war efforts during the American Civil War. Glymph's research emphasizes their sacrifices and challenges the traditional narrative, asserting their agency and right to be recognized as integral to the Union cause, despite facing dismissals from some Union supporters. The lecture underscores the importance of historical representation and reclaiming the forgotten voices of black women in Civil War history."

    "abstract": "This article explores the response of the moderate wing of the civil rights movement to the war in Vietnam. The moderates, made up of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the National Urban League, and leaders such as Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph, were initially opposed to the civil rights movement taking a stand against the war. This reluctance was the result of a number of factors, including anti-communism and their own closeness with the administration of President Lyndon Johnson. Crucially, it also resulted from their own experiences of the black freedom struggle itself.\n\n\n\nThe article also documents and analyses the growing anti-war dissent amongst the moderates, culminating in the decision of both the NAACP and the Urban League to adopt an anti-war stance at the end of the 1960s. Despite this, they remained unenthusiastic about participating in peace movement activities, and the reasons for this are explained. Finally, the article suggests that the war was important in exposing existing divisions within the civil rights movement, as well as in generating new ones",

One of the primary opportunities for public expression of remembrance was Decoration Day, now known as Memorial Day. African Americans played a critical part in the creation of this holiday. On May 1, 1865, the newly-freed black residents of Charleston asserted their place in Civil War memory by leading a parade to a recently constructed cemetery for Union prisoners at the city’s horseracing course. The procession heaped flowers upon the graves of the honored dead, after which ministers from the town’s black congregations gave dedicatory speeches. This event, known among some in the North as the “First Decoration Day,” exemplified African American interest in perpetuating the memory of the Civil War. However, the resentment of white Southerners at the time towards this instance of black agency led to the marginalization and eventual forgetting of the event in the mind of the public at large",

    "abstract": "My last post recounted some of my favorite takeaways from my Civil War road trip this summer. But this trip was about more than just mosquito bites and cheap donuts; it was the first time I ever visited a historical site as a student of public history. My first tour was with Elizabeth Smith ’17 at the Sunken Road at Fredericksburg. Elizabeth’s tour was unique in that she was able to connect the events that transpired along Marye’s Heights, a moderately nuanced subject, to President Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, a very well-known subject. I was delighted to see this connection that appealed to a wide audience. For the hardcore Civil Warrior, Elizabeth’s accounts of the 5th New Hampshire and Cobb’s Georgia Legion gave the military historian exactly what he or she was looking for. Tying the mortality of the common soldier and the pathos of the war-torn nation that was so evident at Fredericksburg to the familiar and powerful Gettysburg Address gave the casual Civil War enthusiast something relatable (and perhaps it provided a new perspective to the hardened military historian as well). Her knowledge of her audience combined with her ability to connect broad themes to specifics and the importance of location demonstrated Elizabeth’s skill as a public historian [excerpt]",

We consider the eect of variations in the Palmer Drought Severity Index (Palmer 1965) - a cumulative index that combines precipitation, temperature and the local characteristics of the soil - on the risk of civil war. While the recent, contentious debate on the link between climate and civil war has mainly focused on precipitation and temperature, without obtaining converging results, the Palmer index describes social exposure to water stress in a more ecient way. We show that it is a key factor of civil war in sub-Saharan Africa and that this result is robust to various specications and passes a series of sensitivity tests. Also, our results indicate that agriculture, ethnic diversity and institutional quality are important factors to link climate and civil war.",

It utilizes the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a cumulative measure of hydrological stress, arguing it is more effective than precipitation or temperature alone for describing social exposure to water stress. The study employs a large dataset and various sensitivity tests, including country fixed effects and alternative sample periods, to establish a robust link between drought and civil war in post-independence sub-Saharan African states.

Fewell and his family. In 1872, the youngest daughter of the prominent Fewell family was seduced and abducted by Prince Williams County’s Commonwealth Attorney and most prominent orator, James F. Clark without warning. Having just come home from three years of military service in the Civil War, witnessing the death of his twin brother as well as suffering for a year in Elmira Prison as a prisoner of war, Lucien N. Fewell walked into Clark’s jail and murdered his younger sister’s abductor. Acquitted of murder on the terms of mental illness, Lucien Fewell continued to live a life of violence caused by his traumatic experiences during the Civil War. Like many soldiers who came home from the Civil War, Lucien Fewell gives historians an insight into those who came home with combat-induced mental illnesses, as he came back from his military services a changed and violent man",

The author, a National Park Service employee, aims to demonstrate that historical topics can be discussed from diverse perspectives and contexts. The work visualizes the environmental impacts of the Civil War, calculating the carbon footprint of transporting fodder for the Army of the Potomac's artillery. Using mid-19th century steam engine data, it quantifies coal consumption and CO2 emissions, revealing that the war's transport carbon cost for artillery feed was equivalent to only 48 hours of a modern coal-burning power plant's production.

Challenging dominant narratives of the war, Phillips argues that nineteenth-century individuals were fully aware of a looming civil war and that many believed it would be a long, bloody, and disastrous conflict, not just a short excursion. As individuals looked to the uncertain future, they all made predictions unique to their race, religion, gender, and location. Some white southern elites saw the looming war as an Armageddon that would destroy civilized society, while abolitionists and slaves saw war as a harbinger of freedom. Phillips seamlessly blends these abstract conceptualizations of war with physical realities by using material culture as his driving impetus, illustrating how nineteenth-century Americans interacted with the physical world in a way that both illustrated and influenced their conceptions of the future.

Doctors from Philadelphia's Mütter Museum surveyed Civil War amputee veterans to compile records on their war injuries. Gardner's vivid survey responses detailed his amputations, healing, difficulties, and artificial limb use.

A unique pattern in the agricultural South, characterized by reliance on work experience over formal education and racial discrimination in schooling, significantly lowered human capital accumulation for both Black and white populations. This low human capital, coupled with post-Civil War resistance to education, substantially reduced the speed of Southern conditional convergence towards the rest of the nation."

    "abstract": "When rebel groups engage incumbent governments in war for control of the state, questions of international recognition arise. International recognition determines which combatants can draw on state assets, receive overt military aid, and borrow as sovereigns—all of which can have profound consequences for the military balance during civil war. How do third-party states and international organizations determine whom to treat as a state's official government during civil war? Data from the sixty-one center-seeking wars initiated from 1945 to 2014 indicate that military victory is not a prerequisite for recognition. Instead, states generally rely on a simple test: control of the capital city. Seizing the capital does not foreshadow military victory. Civil wars often continue for many years after rebels take control and receive recognition. While geopolitical and economic motives outweigh the capital control test in a small number of important cases, combatants appear to anticipate that holding the capital will be sufficient for recognition. This expectation generates perverse incentives. In effect, the international community rewards combatants for capturing or holding, by any means necessary, an area with high concentrations of critical infrastructure and civilians. In the majority of cases where rebels contest the capital, more than half of its infrastructure is damaged or the majority of civilians are displaced (or both), likely fueling long-term state weakness",

    "summary": "This study investigates how international recognition shapes the conduct of civil wars, focusing on how third-party states and international organizations determine which combatant to recognize as a state's official government. Analyzing data from sixty-one center-seeking wars (1945-2014), the research finds that control of the capital city, rather than military victory, is the primary criterion for recognition. This incentivizes combatants to capture or hold capitals by any means, often resulting in significant damage to infrastructure and displacement of civilians, which fuels long-term state weakness. The paper suggests alternative recognition criteria, such as battlefield conduct, to improve outcomes during civil conflict."

    "title": "The End is Near: The Civil War in 1864",
    "abstract": "In the minds of most Civil War lovers, the year 1864 marks the noticeable shift from a conciliatory war to a hard war. Most view it through the lens of Ulysses S. Grant’s Overland Campaign, through William Tecumseh Sherman’s March to the Sea, through the successes of the Union Army. After all, the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 is seen as the ‘high tide of the Confederacy,’ marking the falling action point in the war when total Union victory became inevitable. But in actuality, 1864 was just as—if not more—critical to the outcome of the war than the prior three years. The changing character of the war in that year muddled who was actually succeeding, making clear winners and losers unknown. Additionally, Abraham Lincoln’s reelection hung in the balance; a presidential change-up would alter the nature of war, especially if George B. McClellan were victorious. [excerpt",

    "summary": "This study challenges the conventional view of 1864 in the American Civil War as merely a period of inevitable Union victory following Gettysburg. It argues that 1864 was a critical year marked by a shift to a 'hard war' where clear winners and losers were obscured, and Abraham Lincoln's reelection hung in the balance, potentially altering the war's nature. The research highlights the uncertainty experienced by both soldiers and civilians, suggesting that decisive victories were absent and the war's conclusion remained ambiguous until 1865, thus urging a re-evaluation of historical hindsight."

Muslim Americans are rarely the focus of Civil War scholars and are typically viewed as a demographic relevant only to more modern history. This should not be the case. In fact, Muslim Americans have served in virtually every armed conflict in United States history and left their mark on every era, including the Civil War. A simple search using the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System (CWSS) reveals several names associated with Islam, including two Mahomets, two Hasans, three Rahmans, three Alis, 17 Saids, and 58 Hassans. In his Muslim Veterans of American Wars, Amir N. Muhammad theorized that as many as 292 Muslim last names appear in muster roles. Additionally, as many as 15% of African slaves brought to America are believed to have practiced Islam. While these summary statistics provide an overview of the scope of Muslim American involvement in the Civil War Era, their personal stories truly show their importance in shaping America",

    "abstract": "BBC America’s programming covers a wide range of genres, presenting characters, and settings that appeal to viewers around the world. In 2012, BBC began airing Copper, a period drama set in the ethnically diverse, crime and disease-ridden Five Points neighborhood in New York City in the late-Civil War years. The title, taken from the slang term for a police officer, centers on police detective work in the rapidly growing urban center. The characterizations, as well as the situations presented are not far off from historical fact. For various reasons, many of the characters have returned to the Five Points, and their experiences in war have ended, though the war itself rages on. As a result, their attitudes take on an historical tone of post-Civil War society, though the show takes place in the late-war years of 1863 and 1864. This is not an anachronistic flaw in the show, but rather depicts the characters’ own struggles to carry on in American society through the late-war years now that they have returned from war, and that their combat experiences have come to an end. Therefore, the following questions arise: what post-Civil War themes does “Copper” depict for television audiences, and how does the show contribute to the surge of both print and mass media in relation to the American Civil War? In this segment, we will consider the themes found in the show in terms of the post-war sentiments expressed by characters. [excerpt",

Inter-group fighting weakens potential opposition to the ruler, thereby allowing him to increase fiscal pressure. We show that the presence of natural resources exacerbatesthe incentives of the ruler to promote civil conflict for his own profit, especially if the resources are unequally distributed across ethnic groups. We validate the main predictions of the model using cross-country data over the period 1960-2007, and show that our empirical results are not likely to be driven by omitted observable determinants of civil war incidence or by unobservable country-specific heterogeneity.",

    "summary": "This study proposes a model where an autocrat in an ethnically divided society maximizes rents by setting tax rates on domestic production and natural resources, under the threat of revolution. The model demonstrates that a weak ruler may incite civil war to boost personal rents, as inter-group fighting weakens opposition, enabling increased fiscal pressure. The presence of natural resources, especially if unevenly distributed among ethnic groups, exacerbates the ruler's incentive to promote conflict. The model's predictions are validated using cross-country data from 1960-2007, showing robust empirical results not influenced by omitted variables or unobservable heterogeneity. Key concepts include autocracy, ethnic division, natural resources, civil conflict, and fiscal policy."

One must consider the “clannish nature” of theater of the time in order to understand how actors could have taken the neutral role during a war of ideals: many actors were born into theater life, therefore did not grow up in any one city or region, and furthermore lived a life separate from the outside world where harsh realities allowed for the existence of slavery and social oppression.

It highlights that many actors maintained neutrality or even left the country due to the insular, \"clannish nature\" of theatrical life, as actors often lacked strong regional ties. While some performances fostered patriotism or offered satirical commentary, public sentiment and growing casualty lists increasingly made war a taboo subject, turning theater into a form of escapism rather than a direct reflection of conflict.

They present empirical evidence that they interpret as consistent with their argument: a statistically significant correlation between pathogen intensity and civil war onset. In this comment, we raise concerns over their interpretation of the empirical evidence and their proposed causal mechanisms. We find that the data provide stronger evidence for the reverse causal relationship, namely that civil war causes disease to become more prevalent.

    "abstract": "Shaping historical memory means extracting lessons from the past. Those lessons frame the debate about the nature of the present. Just months after the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson, the attention of most of the nation focused on the events scheduled to commemorate the semi-centennial of what was by then increasingly viewed as “the turning point” of the Civil War. The reunion at Gettysburg in 1913 constituted the contemporary public exegesis of the status of American memory of the Civil War. In this respect, the reunion in Gettysburg reflected the erasure of the legacy of emancipation and the unfulfilled promise of equality for African-Americans. Yet, almost all the public discourse at Gettysburg reflected no sense of disappointment; rather, the battle now represented a triumph of the American spirit. The presence of AfricanAmerican veterans would have complicated the message of white reconciliation at the reunion. Reckoning with the honorable service of black troops was not something mainstream American society felt comfortable with in 1913. Whether or not black veterans attended the fiftieth anniversary of Gettysburg is a small detail which illuminates a profoundly broader pair of subjects: the meaning of the Civil War and the nature of American race relations in 1913. In answering this question of black veterans at the Gettysburg reunion, the broader context of the organization and execution of the reunion, the lessons drawn from the ceremonies in Gettysburg, explicit discussions of race at the reunion and contemporary African-American perspectives must all be explored.

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of civil war on high skilled emigration rates to the OECD over the period 1985-2000. Controlling for economic and institutional characteristics of source countries, we find that civil war increases high skilled emigration by about 5 percent on the average. However, the nature of conflict matters: While brain drain from countries with ethnic conflict is about 6-8 percent greater on average than it is from countries without conflict, brain drain from countries with nonethnic conflict is less, and statistically insignificant. Duration also matters: Each additional year of ethnic conflict worsens the brain drain by between 0.4 and 1 percent, whereas the effect of an additional year of nonethnic conflict is small and insignificant.",

Utilizing controls for economic and institutional factors in source nations, the research reveals that civil war, on average, escalates high-skilled emigration by approximately 5 percent. The nature and duration of conflict are critical; ethnic conflict significantly worsens brain drain (6-8% greater, 0.4-1% per additional year), while nonethnic conflict shows less and statistically insignificant impact. This research highlights the differentiated effects of conflict types on international migration patterns and brain drain."

Initially critical of the exhibit, the author, John M. Rudy, later re-evaluated his stance, recognizing the provocative display's profound commentary on the flag. The piece explores the evolving symbolism of the Confederate Flag, from its origins in the Civil War to its controversial use during the Jim Crow era and beyond. It critically examines how the flag became associated with hate speech and institutional segregation, questioning its contemporary display and its impact on visitors, particularly African Americans, at historical sites."

    "abstract": "The effects of economic development are enormously important in understanding the causes of civil war and the requirements for successful post-conflict reconstruction. In recent decades we have seen an increase in the number of civil wars because of a phenomenon known as the conflict trap. I question why we see an increase in civil wars and what role unstable economic development plays in contributing to the conflict trap. This paper offers evidence to support the hypothesis that uneven economic development increases the risk of multiple civil wars occurring in a short amount of time. Based on the results of testing my hypothesis I suggest that the conflict trap can be broken, and the risk of civil war decreased, when economic growth is stabilized. I suggest participation in the global economic community as a mechanism for stabilizing economic growth",

    "abstract": "Civil wars impose substantial costs on the domestic economy. We empirically measure the economic impact of such internal wars. The paper contributes to the existing literature both theoretically and methodologically. First, it explores the economic channels through which civil war affects growth. Previous studies have shown the negative growth effects of civil wars. We go a step further by identifying the channels through which war strips a country of its growth potential. Our argument is that civil war negatively impacts private investment through the process of portfolio substitution. Methodologically, the paper improves on both the data and statistical models used in the existing literature. Our data set includes better measurements of the intensity and scope of civil war as well as new economic and political data for the 1990s. Moreover, using a multiple imputation technique, we minimize the estimation bias due to missing data. Finally, to improve the model, we apply fixed and random effects models to the panel data. The evidence gives strong support to our argument indicating that the driving force behind the negative effects of civil war on economic growth is a decrease in private investment.civil war, instability, economic growth, investment, fiscal balance",

The series seeks to promote a broad interdisciplinary dialogue on how to accelerate sustainable development at all levels.The Green Revolution in agriculture greatly increased crop yields and averted mass starvation, but it also turned small farms into factory farms that concentrated production in a few locations and reduced the diversity of crops. In this paper, Professor Nalin Kulatilaka, Co-Director of BU’s Clean Energy & Environmental Sustainability Initiative, calls for a Green Energy Revolution that decentralizes energy supplies through a smart electricity network. He argues that such a revolution could provide for a diversity of energy sources located closer to users, which in turn could shift consumption patterns, reduce losses and decrease overall energy demand. He concludes that shifting to such a system “will adopt clean energy technologies while fostering new businesses, creating new jobs and ultimately empowering society to reach new heights in energy conservation and sustainability“",

Alexander Fleming’s discovery of Penicillin sparked the development of antibiotics, which has continued to save people’s lives since the revolution. Thomas Kuhn would qualify the discovery of Penicillin by Alexander Fleming as a revolution because it led to a paradigm shift. Prior to the discovery of Penicillin, patients died from trivial injuries and infections. Fleming’s discovery of Penicillin is revolutionary because it changed the worldview of the way doctors treat patients with infectious diseases; and as a result of the antibiotic revolution, individuals are not vulnerable to death by bacterial diseases",

In its first part, I critically discuss the microfoundations requirement that constitutes a cornerstone of the new approach and suggest an alternative, softer, formulation of it. The conclusion of this discussion is that the new classical/real business cycle revolution marked a transition from a soft to a demanding understanding of the microfoundations requirement. In the second part of the paper, I present additional salient traits of the new classical and the real business cycle stages of the revolution. While each of these stages brought a specific contribution to the revolution, I emphasize the decisive role played by Kydland and Prescott in re-orienting the type of work in which macroeconomists were engaged. Finally, in part three, I ponder upon the causes of this revolution. After presenting and assessing Prescott’s and Lucas’s accounts of the factors which gave rise to the new approach, I venture into muddier waters by raising the question of whether a political agenda underpinned the NC/RBC revolution.",

    "abstract": "It is conventionally assumed that the pre-modern working year was fixed and that consumption varied with changes in wages and prices. This is challenged by the twin theories of the ‘industrious’ revolution and the consumer revolution, positing a longer working year as people earned surplus money to buy novel goods. In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we use a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the working year of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that. By comparing with independent estimates of the actual working year, we find two ‘industrious’ revolutions among rural workers; both, however, are attributable to economic hardship, and we detect no signs of a consumer revolution. For urban labourers, by contrast, a growing gap between their actual working year and the work required to buy the basket provides great scope for a consumer revolution.Consumer Revolution; Cost-of-Living Index; Day Wages; ‘Industrious’ Revolution; Industrial Revolution; Labour Supply; Standard of Living",

Historians’ history of science does well to take in the long run from the Greek and Hebrew heritages on, and to work at avoiding misleading anachronism and teleology. As an alternative to the usual “evo-revo” themes, a historiography of origins and species, of cosmologies (including microcosmogonies and macrocosmogonies) and ontologies, is developed here. The advantages of such a historiography are illustrated by looking briefly at a number of transitions the transition from Greek and Hebrew doctrines to their integrations by medieval authors; the transition from the Platonist, Aristotelian, Christian Aquinas to the Newtonian Buffon and to the no less Newtonian Lamarck; the departures the early Darwin made away from Lamarck’s and from Lyell’s views. Issues concerning historical thinking about nature, concerning essentialism and concerning classification are addressed in an attempt to challenge customary stereotypes. Questions about originality and influence are raised, especially concerning Darwin’s “tree of life” scheme. The broader historiography of Darwinian science as a social ideology, and as a “worldview,” is examined and the scope for revisions emphasised.

    "abstract": "Thesis (M.A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2019The Egyptian uprising, which began on January 25, 2011, and ended on February 11, 2011, culminated in the ending of President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year reign as dictator.  After free elections in which the Muslim Brotherhood ascended to power in the country, they were ousted in a military coup d'état only one year after their ascension to power and were replaced by former military general Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi. The symptoms which led the country to rise up against Mubarak continue to exist under el-Sisi today, indicating that no revolution really took place. This paper answers the question, \"why did the revolution fail?\", offering a rhetorical reason for the revolution's failure. The uprisings, which were billed as decentralized, offer unique opportunities for analysis of rhetorical strategy. This paper uses the reconstitutive-discourse model, a critical model which examines a rhetor's reconstitution of their audience's character, to examine the rhetoric of three different parties in the revolution. First, it examines the rhetoric of all protestors irrespective of source via Twitter and on the ground protestors; next it looks at the rhetoric of Wael Ghonim, who is credited with instigating the uprisings, and Mohammed ElBaradei, an influential figure who became interim vice-president in the aftermath of the uprisings. The study found that first, the uprisings were not really decentralized and indeed has leaders. Further, rhetorical failures on the part of its leaders caused the uprisings to fail in their goal of democratic revolution",

The distinction between sectors producing and sectors using the new technology is emphasized. A major finding for all breakthroughs is that there is a long lag from the time of the original invention until a substantial increase in the rate of productivity growth can be observed. There is also strong evidence of rapid price decreases for steam engines, electricity, electric motors and ICT products. However, there is no persuasive direct evidence that the steam engine producing industry and electric machinery had particularly high productivity growth rates. For the ICT revolution the highest productivity growth rates are found in the ICT-producing industries. We suggest that one explanation could be that hedonic price indexes are not used for the steam engine and the electric motor. Still, it is likely that the rate of technological development has been much more rapid during the ICT revolution compared to any of the previous breakthroughs.electrification; general purpose technologies; ICT revolution; productivity growth; steam power; Technological breakthroughs",

After this revolution, however, several decades passed before these new technologies diffused and measured productivity growth increased. We build a quantitative model of technology diffusion which we use to study this transition to a new economy. We show that the model implies both slow diffusion and a delay in growth similar to that in the data. Our model casts doubt, however, on the conjecture that this experience is a useful parallel for understanding the productivity paradox following the Information Technology Revolution.",

Focusing on the Second Industrial Revolution (1860-1900), the model explains the observed slow diffusion of new technologies, the delay in productivity growth, and ongoing investment in older technologies. By quantifying the learning process using U.S. manufacturing plant data, the authors demonstrate that the nature of transition depends on the amount of accumulated knowledge about old technologies. The findings suggest the experience of the Second Industrial Revolution may not be a direct parallel for the Information Technology Revolution due to varying historical contexts impacting diffusion and growth rates."

This revolution, sometimes called the digital revolution, is the revolutionary transformation brought about in the information and communication structure of society by the advent of the digital computer, with most of the major transformations having taken place in the past thirty years. Digital computing technology has generated the mainframe and personal computer, the multimedia computer, and computer networks. It has also transformed the telephone system and the monetary system, it is transforming all kinds of conventional products ranging from washing machines to automobiles, and it is on its way to change television as well. More than ever, contemporary society is an Information Society, in which the importance of information and communication is much greater than in past societies, and of which technologies that facilitate information and communication processes are a central societal feature. In this paper, I want to evaluate the implications of contemporary information and communication media for the quality of life, including both the new media from the digital revolution and the older media that still remain in use. My evaluation of contemporary media will proceed in three parts. In the section to follow, the benefits of contemporary media will be discussed, with special emphasis given to their immediate functional benefits. The section thereafter is devoted to a discussion of four potential threats posed by contemporary media. In a final major section, I look at the future of digital media and the possibilities available to us in shaping that future. A short concluding section ends the paper",

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016This project examines the various drivers that led to the U.S. shale oil revolution in order to predict its place in the energy industry going forward and to analyze its effects on Alaska. The shale boom flooded the market with oil causing a dramatic decrease in crude oil prices in late 2014. With this price drop threatening to send Alaska into an economic recession, the future of shale should be of primary concern to all Alaskans as well as other entities that rely heavily on oil revenue. The primary driver leading to the shale revolution is technology. Advances in hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and 3D seismic mapping made producing shale oil and gas possible for the first time. New technologies like rotary steerable systems and measurements while drilling continue to make shale production more efficient, and technology will likely continue to improve. Infrastructure helps to explain why the shale revolution was mostly an American phenomenon. Many countries with shale formations have political infrastructure too unstable to risk shale investment. Capital infrastructure is a primary strength of the U.S. and also helps to explain why shale development didn't find its way up to Alaska despite having political stability. Financial infrastructure allowed oil companies to receive the funding necessary to quickly bring shale to the market. The final driver explored is crude oil prices. High oil prices helped spark the shale revolution, but with the recent price crash, there is uncertainty about its future. With production costs continually falling due to technology improvements and analysts predicting crude oil prices to stabilize above most project breakeven points, the future of shale looks bright.Introduction -- Shale & Alaska North Slope Crude Oil Prices -- Seeds of its own destruction?

Infrastructure—political, capital, and financial—explains the revolution's American focus. High crude oil prices initially spurred growth, but a recent price crash created uncertainty. However, with falling production costs and anticipated price stabilization, the future of shale oil appears robust, profoundly affecting Alaska's economic outlook."

    "abstract": "Difference and Repetition might be said to have brought about a Deleuzian Revolution in philosophy comparable to Kant’s Copernican Revolution. Kant had denounced the three great terminal points of traditional metaphysics – self, world and God – as transcendent illusions, and Deleuze pushes Kant’s revolution to its limit by positing a transcendental field that excludes the coherence of the self, world and God in favour of an immanent and differential plane of impersonal individuations and pre-individual singularities. In the process, he introduces numerous conceptual innovations into philosophy: the becoming of concepts; a transformation of the form of the question; an insistence that philosophy must start in the middle; an attempt to think in terms of multiplicities; the development of a new logic and a new metaphysics based on a concept of difference; a new conception of space as intensive rather than extensive; a conception of time as a pure and empty form; and an understanding of philosophy as a system in heterogenesis – that is, a system that entails a perpetual genesis of the heterogeneous, an incessant production of the new. \n          \n          Keywords: concepts, becoming, multiplicity, singularity, the middle [au milieu], difference, intensity, time, system, the ne",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct two \"counterfactual\" simulations for the 30-year period 1970-2000-the first holding 1970 crop genetic improvements (CGI) constant and the second presuming the International Agricultural Research Center (IARC) system had not been built. Both these counterfactuals apply to developing countries only. The core estimates on which the counterfactuals are based include country fixed effects , and the key estimates are for the Dietary Energy Sufficiency (DES) equation. DES affects birth rates, death rates, child mortality rates and malnutrition rates, making it possible to \"endogenize\" population growth in developing countries, in the counterfactuals. Reduced DES levels (from reduced CGI contributions) will lead to more births, more deaths and more child deaths and higher levels of malnutrition. The key technology variables that determine DES are the number of agricultural scientists per million hectares of cropland, the average years of schooling of adult males (over 25), and the level of Green Revolution Modern Varieties (GRMV) adoption. Our results show striking contrasts between the historical record and the alternative counterfactuals. The worst outcome is that without any Green Revolution Technologies or an IARC system to support it, which results in holding technological advancements constant at the 1970 level is a marginal improvement, leading to much higher prices over time, as agricultural production struggles to keep up with food demand in those countries. The endogenous feedback effects of population show the importance of nutrition and education, and argue strongly in favor of those factors playing a significant role in the improvement of human well-being that has been observed since the start of the Green Revolution to present.Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,",

    "abstract": "In the context of the current crisis of global capitalism, it is crucial to determine what is the state of Marxism. Certainly, it is true that in recent decades Marxism has suffered a notable series of attacks, but in no way may we conclude that for this reason Marxism no longer constitutes a legitimate political and intellectual option. As Perry Anderson fittingly pointed out, “to be defeated and to be bowed are not the same” (Anderson 2005: XVII). In permanent crisis and despite all adversities—Marxism persists. Thus, adopting the standpoint of an “intransigent realism” (Anderson 2000: 10) which makes possible “refusing any accommodation with the ruling system, and rejecting every piety and euphemism that would understate its power” (idem), it is valid to question if Marxism has theoretically and practically recovered from a crisis that was supposedly fatal. In fact, has Marxism been able to respond to the challenges posed by Post-Structuralism and 2 Postmodernist discourse? Has it repelled the attacks that were inherent in the postulates of the so-called Post-Marxism? As a part of a larger effort to answer these questions, this paper deals with the work of Slavoj Žižek. What distinguishes the Slovenian philosopher from other contemporary thinkers that try to normatively undertake a defense of Marxism is that he is not precisely a Marxist. Essentially, Žižek is part of the Lacanian left (Stravrakakis 2007). But at the same time he is a very distinctive Hegelian that belongs to the field of Materialist Theory of Subjectivity (Johnston 2008). Nevertheless, in recent years Žižek has showed increasing fidelity to the Idea of communism and the radical emancipatory politics. Within this context, he has strayed from his previous interests in the development of ideology critique and has carried out a noteworthy number of original contributions to both the vicissitudes of Marxist theory and the political practice that the times in which we live require.Fil: Roggerone, Santiago Martín.

It outlines key events from the Estates General meeting in 1789 and explores the core belief system embedded within the Revolution. The article also examines the legislative process, specifically the codification effort that culminated in the Napoleonic Codes, including the influence of Natural Law philosophy and its eventual exclusion from the final Civil Code, highlighting its inspirational role in the codification process. This piece serves as a historical analysis of the French Revolution's impact on legal codification."

    "title": "\"New Songs of the Battlefield\": Songs and Memories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution",
    "abstract": "This dissertation focuses on a five-volume anthology of songs published from 1972 to 1976 known as \"Zhandi Xinge,\" literally \"New Songs of the Battlefield.\" The songs represent a significant portion of the limited musical expression during a period in China known as the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Published and approved by the Chinese Communist Party, the anthology appeared at a time when artistic and musical activities were extremely restricted. The government utilized this particular musical form for multiple goals, including the propagation of political ideologies, stimulation of party support, and education of the masses. Based upon original research and personal interviews, the dissertation provides the first documentation and analysis of the anthology in any language. Analysis focuses on the official ideology as situated in its socio-historical context, and an examination of individual reception and memory. The study begins with an introduction to the Cultural Revolution period, followed by an investigation of the composition, editing, compilation, themes, texts, and musical characteristics of the anthology. The dissertation concludes with an analysis of the contemporary memory of Cultural Revolution songs while considering concepts of music, memory, and nostalgia. The analysis reveals that the major factors influencing how the music is remembered and who remembers it, is dependent upon a combination of features including music and memory, generational imprinting and changes in contemporary Chinese society",

    "abstract": "Impact of school interruptions on earnings through lower subsequent educational attainment and lower quality of education is investigated using the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a natural experiment. During the Cultural Revolution, most schools in China stopped normal operation for 3 to 4 years, universities stopped normal student recruitment for an even longer period. Such large scale school interruptions reduced the opportunity of the cohort to obtain university degrees. We find that individuals who did not obtain a university degree becasue of the Cultural revolution on average lost 46 per cent of their potential earnings. In addition most of the cohort experienced missed or interrupted schooling, at a given level of education and we show that this reduced earnings of degree holders of the Cultural Revolution cohort by 7.3 per cent on average. The findings in this paper also indicate that the quality of schooling affected earnings of individuals in a non-linear way, that is, only missed schooling at junior and senior high level reduced subsequent earnings and it only reduced earnings of those with degrees.",

The present work shows that scale economies and demand, combined with the conditions of the relative prices of input factors, allow to provide a purely economic answer to this question. The labor-saving innovations of the Industrial Revolution were profitable only if, after their adoption, sales expanded enough to cover the upfront cost of capital. For some time, England was the only country in which sales exceeded the minimum threshold required to make adoption profitable. This fact is illustrated here by means of a detailed case study centered on the cotton industry and on the adoption of the spinning jenny in England and in France at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. By then, the sufficiently large and relatively well-off English middle class could guarantee to cotton spinners a level of sales that was not viable in France, where income was lower and more concentrated in the hands of the upper classes.Industrial Revolution, income distribution, economies of scale, choice of technique, spinning jenny",

The latter is frequently understood as sociology's special object with sociology itself a distinctively modern form of explanation. The period of sociology's disciplinary formation was also the heyday of European colonialism, yet the colonial relationship did not figure in the development of sociological understandings. While the recent emergence of postcolonialism appears to have initiated a reconsideration of understandings of modernity, with the development of theories of multiple modernities, I suggest that this engagement is more an attempt at recuperating the transformative aspect of postcolonialism than engaging with its critiques. In setting out the challenge of postcolonialism to dominant sociological accounts, I also address `missing feminist/queer revolutions', suggesting that by engaging with postcolonialism there is the potential to transform sociological understandings by opening up a dialogue beyond the simple pluralism of identity claims",

We make use of a rich dataset consisting of panel data collected before and after the so called “Orange” revolution in Ukraine. Our empirical approach tackles two different –and equally interesting– features of the revolution: the determinants of participation (both in the protests and counter-protests) and the “selection” of participants into different levels of involvement (i.e. intensity of participation). We consider different drivers of participation, from traditional proxies for opportunities and grievances, but we also analyze the role of political and economic preferences, risk tolerance, life satisfaction, and indicators of network connectivity. What emerges from this study is a more nuanced pattern of participation that does not link uniquely to a single theoretical model.",

    "abstract": "The years between 1865 and 1877, which form the period in American history known as Reconstruction, compose a sort of coda to the traumatic opera of the American Civil War of 1861–65. Reconstruction embraces the twelve years of active effort to rebuild the American Union, though in some sense (because Reconstruction had no official starting or ending date) aspects of it spluttered on well into the 1890s. I use the word spluttered deliberately, because Reconstruction is also the ugly duckling of American history in the eyes of many American historians, and something the public considers vaguely awful if it thinks of it at all. Absent from Reconstruction are the conflict and the personalities that make the Civil War so colorful; it also lacks the climactic battles and dissipates into a confusing and wearisome tale of lost opportunities, squalid victories, and embarrassing defeats. It was, proclaimed one veteran of the Army of Northern Virginia, “not peace established in power, but captured in shame; not throned on high by willing witnesses, but pinned to the earth by imperial steel—the peace of the bayonet.” In many cases, especially for those who regard Reconstruction as an unrelieved misery, almost the worst thing that can be said about someone is that they were prominent in Reconstruction",

    "title": "The dictator’s dilemma: the role of social media in revolutions",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a revolution model incorporating the effects of social media. It is seen that social media changes the outcomes of traditional revolution models due its effects on the cost/benefit analysis of would-be participants. The paper also considers various strategies for the dictator to stop the revolution in light of social media. Finally, the paper offers extensions and different ways to evaluate the effectiveness of social media in a revolution.•Introduction: So, you want to be a dictator? These days, it is tougher to lead an authoritarian regime in the face of democratic ideals, free speech and globalized media. Look to the Arab Spring, the inspiration for this paper, as an example of dictators overthrown by these modern forces. Rebels mobilized in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya against longstanding dictators to achieve a self-determined life. This paper hopes to find ways to help you, the would-be dictator, stay in power. In order to do this, the paper will explore and model the factors that encourage the overthrow of a dictator and hence inform how the dictator can rebuff any rebellions before they start.All revolutions differ; perhaps, however, modern and future revolutions have fundamentally changed due to the internet and social media. The greatest problem for would-be revolutionaries is organization. Social media helps overcome collective action problems by dissemination of information to organize people. Facebook and Twitter brought people to Tahrir Square in Egypt to protest Hosni Mubarek because they were inspired by posted messages and videos. Wael Gholim created a Facebook page “We Are All Khaled Saeed” that created an online arena for people to share their discontent. When the page called for protests on January 25th, hundreds of thousands mobilized.Social media has also changed the effectiveness of the dictator’s methods to quell a revolution. In the past, a dictator could kill a dissident to silence him while only angering a few close relatives and friends. Today, as in the case of Khaled Saeed, the deceased can become a rallying cry for thousands and his message quickly spread. The dictator’s action, while silencing one, angers thousands. Since the revolutionaries’ tactics have changed, perhaps the dictators need to as well. In some Asian countries, authoritarian regimes restrict internet access such as China’s “great firewall”. Pakistan has decided to build its own web wall to partially block users from certain websites while North Korea effectively does not have internet.&nbsp; Restricting the internet involves a trade-off between the internet’s efficiency gains and the possibility of social unrest.Of course, there is always the good old-fashioned bribe. The problem is enforcing the bribe. Hopefully, the bribe is not taken and then used against the dictator. Instead of a cash bribe, the dictator could employ or create governmental positions for his opposition. This co-option of leading revolutionaries may help kill a revolution before it starts.&nbsp; Perhaps the best method of keeping a revolution at bay is to make the people happier by governing better.The dictator has many choices to stop a revolution; some more effective than others. In order to examine the dictator’s choices, a revolution model needs to be constructed",

The authors show that these metrics form dual pairs, related by a Wick rotation that preserves ambient symmetry. Consequently, the embedding of the real surface also depends on a real parameter, where the surface gravity of the black hole horizon is inversely proportional to the cone angle of the ambient space. The study also provides a simplified formula for the Gaussian curvature of the black hole spacetime slice, which can be useful in general relativity and differential geometry."

    "title": "Mayakovsky’s Bedbug: Revolution, Time and Utopia",
    "abstract": "The article was submitted on 25.04.2017.In Russia, the very idea of a Communist revolution – from 1905 onwards – meant both hope and dread. This attitude is quite clearly shown in a very significant part of the Russian literary process, from 1908 to the beginning of the Stalin era. An obvious thread, in fact, connects Aleksandr Bogdanov (Red Star, 1908), Evgeny Zamyatin (We, 1921) and Vladimir Mayakovsky (The Bedbug, 1929): the growing awareness that the Communist revolution, as Lenin had conceived it, was little more than a model and that a model could not describe – much less forecast – a complex reality (a complex system) like a social and political one. As a result of this awareness, hope and a dark prophecy (Bogdanov) slowly turn into despair (Mayakovsky). The model is subsumed by Vladimir Mayakovsky’s dystopian satire of The Bedbug and The Bathhouse which propose a new paradigm of dystopia: a bottleneck in the flow of the information produced by blind adherence to a preconceived project that prevents the discovery and the implementation of la volonté générale in so complex a system as human society.Для периода господства революционных идей в России начала XX в. были характерны противоречивые настроения надежды и страха. Это ярко проявлялось и во многих произведениях русской литературы, начиная с 1908 г. и вплоть до сталинской эпохи. Такие представления были связующей нитью для творчества Александра Богданова (Красная Звезда, 1908), Евгения Замятина (Мы, 1921) и Владимира Маяковского (Клоп, 1929): по их изменениям можно проследить то, как в сознании людей росло убеждение, что коммунистическая революция – всего лишь абстрактная модель. А модель не может описать и, тем более, предсказать сложную реальность, включающую в себя социальную и политическую системы. Из осознания этого факта, по мнению автора, и происходит мрачное пророчество А. Богданова (соединенное с надеждой), которое затем перерастает в отчаяние у В. Маяковского. Эта модель представлена в сатире Маяковского – в «Клопе» и «Бане», в которых возникает новая парадигма антиутопии: информационная ограниченность, вызванная слепым следованием заранее заданному замыслу, препятствует открытию и внедрению volonté générale (всеобщей воли как результата ограничения людьми своих прав) в такой сложной системе как человеческое общество",

    "abstract": "Before 1911, when Hermann Oppenheim introduced the term dystonia, this movement disorder lacked a unifying descriptor. While words like epilepsy, apoplexy, and palsy have had their meanings since antiquity, references to dystonia are much harder to identify in historical documents. Torticollis is an exception, although there is difficulty distinguishing dystonic torticollis from congenital muscular torticollis. There are, nevertheless, possible representations of dystonia in literature and visual art from the pre-modern world. Eighteenth century systematic nosologists such as Linnaeus, de Sauvages, and Cullen had attempted to classify some spasmodic conditions, including torticollis. But only after Charcot's contributions to clinical neuroscience were the various forms of generalized and focal dystonia clearly delineated. They were categorized as névroses: Charcot's term for conditions without an identifiable neuroanatomical cause. For a time thereafter, psychoanalytic models of dystonia based on Freud's ideas about unconscious conflicts transduced into physical symptoms were ascendant, although there was always a dissenting “organic” school. With the rise of subspecialization in movement disorders during the 1970s, the pendulum swung strongly back toward organic causation. David Marsden's clinical and electrophysiological research on the adult-onset focal dystonias was particularly important in establishing a physical basis for these disorders. We are still in a period of “living history” of dystonia, with much yet to be understood about pathophysiology. Rigidly dualistic models have crumbled in the face of evidence of electrophysiological and psychopathological overlap between organic and functional dystonia. More flexible biopsychosocial frameworks may address the demand for new diagnostic and therapeutic rationales",

The study aims to decipher the life history and environmental information from European oyster (Ostrea edulis) shells by analyzing geochemical variations. This method provides independent measures of age, season of death, temperature, and salinity throughout the oyster's life. Understanding modern oyster shells allows for analyzing archaeological shells to gain historical perspectives on harvesting practices and environmental shifts in ancient shellfisheries, contributing to knowledge on environmental reconstruction and human-environment interactions."

    "abstract": "Of the many artifacts found in Gettysburg College’s Musselman library, perhaps the most unusual and seemingly out of place may be the centuries-old replica of a samurai suit and katana standing guard over visitors and students from an oversized glass case on the first floor. Though hard to miss, their connection with Gettysburg College is not so obvious. A plaque located below the suit reads, “Samurai Armor and Warrior Katana; Late 19th Century; Gift of Major General Charles A. Willoughby; Class of 1914.” These artifacts represent hundreds of years of the ancient Samurai tradition in Japan, a crucial element of traditional Japanese culture and history that experienced a resurgence even within the twentieth century. They also symbolize relations between the United States and Japan during and after World War II as narrated by Major General Charles A. Willoughby, Chief of Intelligence under Douglas MacArthur. How and why Major General Willoughby acquired such artifacts is unclear; however, a character study set against the backdrop of this period in history allows us to extrapolate potential theories. Documents within the Gettysburg Special Collections & College Archives offer insights into the man Willoughby was and posit deeper questions about the suit and katana’s journey to the college. This essay illuminates the connection between the college and an ancient culture half way around the globe as well as one of the murkiest mysteries at Gettysburg College",

    "summary": "This article surveys the historical evolution of the definition of primality, specifically focusing on the number one, from ancient Greek mathematicians to modern times. It explores periods when one and three were considered prime, and how definitions of both prime numbers and positive integers have shifted throughout history. The authors discuss reasons for these definitional changes, provide examples, and identify significant mathematicians who historically classified one as prime. This historical analysis clarifies the complex perception of primality for the number one. Keywords: prime number, unity, history of mathematics."

    "title": "Field surveys for ancient woodlands: Issues and Approaches",
    "abstract": "Field surveys of ancient woodlands and potential ancient woodlands can be undertaken for a variety of purposes, including: to help identify an Ancient Woodland, investigation into existing designated ancient woodlands, gathering information for site management and conservation decision making, assessing potential impacts of development, and making decisions on restoration etc. There is a variety of features in a woodland which can indicate whether it is an ancient woodland and can inform on the history and current ecological/historical value of the site. Many surveys of potential ancient woodlands have tended to focus on ancient woodland indicator species (AWIs), particularly Ancient Woodland Vascular Plants (AWVPs). Surveys which just focus on such indicators miss a lot of historical, archaeological and species information which can help confirm woodland continuity (i.e. that it is an ancient woodland) and/or identify features of historical and conservation value. There is a wide range of field survey techniques which can be used in ancient woodlands and a need to bring together the archaeological and ecological surveys in a single guide, hence this document. There are three broad types of feature to look for in an ancient woodland: • Ancient woodland vascular plant indicators; • Tree shape and form; and • Surface and buried archaeology. This report sets out survey methods for these features and advises on what to look for. Many important ecological and archaeological features can only be easily found at specific times of the year and surveying these features requires specific technical expertise and experience. Where surveys are undertaken outside the optimal period of time and/or are undertaken by individuals without the appropriate training and surveying expertise, the results should be treated with caution. Ideally several types of surveys of a woodland should be undertaken at different times of year to maximise the evidence collected and the robustness of this evidence. Where this is not possible, limitations in the surveys need to be stated and recognised in any analysis. In most cases field surveys should be combined with archive surveys (of site history, previous surveys etc.); this is particularly important when identifying ancient woodlands",

    "abstract": "Clay minerals are common in ancient terrains on Mars and their presence at the surface alludes to aqueous processes in the Noachian to Early Hesperian (>3.5 Ga). Gale crater was selected as Curiositys landing site largely because of the identification of clay mineral rich strata from orbit. On Earth, the types of clay minerals (i.e., smectites) identified in Gale crater are typically juvenile weathering products that ultimately record the interaction between primary igneous minerals with the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. Trioctahedral and dioctahedral smectite were identified by Curiosity in units stratigraphically below the Clay Mineral-Bearing Unit (CBU) identified from orbit. Compositional and sedimentological data suggest the smectite formed via authigenesis in a lake environment and may have been altered during early diagenesis. The CBU is stratigraphically equivalent to a hematite-rich unit to the north and stratigraphically underlies sulfate-rich units to the south, suggesting a dynamic environment and evolving history of water in the ancient Gale crater lake. Targeting these clay mineral rich areas on Mars with rover missions provides an opportunity to explore the aqueous and sedimentary history of the planet",

It flourished for over three centuries which set a pattern of example for people\n\nnear and far. \n\nHistorical evidences have shown that Black history eclipsed by far what had been written\n\ndown by European invasion of the “Africa” continent. Before the invasion of Europeans\n\nin the fourteenth century, Blacks had civilization like the Nubian Empire now called\n\nSudan. Historical facts pointed out facts of purely black society that mastered the act of\n\ncraftsmanship of an advance civilization contrary to what was written as a dark people who\n\nleaved in caves and trees. Today there are more than three hundreds pyramids and remnants\n\nof destroyed civilization in Nubia.

Why was the names of ancient Black\n\nKingdom and Empire changed? Why European did invaded Africa?

    "title": "Population history from the Neolithic to present on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia: an ancient DNA perspective",
    "abstract": "Recent ancient DNA studies of western Eurasia have revealed a dynamic history of admixture, with evidence for major migrations during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. The population of the Mediterranean island of Sardinia has been notable in these studies –} Neolithic individuals from mainland Europe cluster more closely with Sardinian individuals than with all other present-day Europeans. The current model to explain this result is that Sardinia received an initial influx of Neolithic ancestry and then remained relatively isolated from expansions in the later Neolithic and Bronze Age that took place in continental Europe. To test this model, we generated genome-wide capture data (approximately 1.2 million variants) for 43 ancient Sardinian individuals spanning the Neolithic through the Bronze Age, including individuals from Sardinia{’}s Nuragic culture, which is known for the construction of numerous large stone towers throughout the island. We analyze these new samples in the context of previously generated genome-wide ancient DNA data from 972 ancient individuals across western Eurasia and whole-genome sequence data from approximately 1,500 modern individuals from Sardinia. The ancient Sardinian individuals show a strong affinity to western Mediterranean Neolithic populations and we infer a high degree of genetic continuity on the island from the Neolithic (around fifth millennium BCE) through the Nuragic period (second millennium BCE). In particular, during the Bronze Age in Sardinia, we do not find significant levels of the {“}Steppe{” ancestry that was spreading in many other parts of Europe at that time. We also characterize subsequent genetic influx between the Nuragic period and the present. We detect novel, modest signals of admixture between 1,000 BCE and present-day, from ancestry sources in the eastern and northern Mediterranean. Within Sardinia, we confirm that populations from the more geographically isolated mountainous provinces have experienced elevated levels of genetic drift and that northern and southwestern regions of the island received more gene flow from outside Sardinia. Overall, our genetic analysis sheds new light on the origin of Neolithic settlement on Sardinia, reinforces models of genetic continuity on the island, and provides enhanced power to detect post-Bronze-Age gene flow. Together, these findings offer a refined demographic model for future medical genetic studies in Sardinia",

    "abstract": "Heavy metals from urban runoff preserved in sedimentary deposits record long-term economic and industrial development via the expansion and contraction of a city’s infrastructure. Lead concentrations and isotopic compositions measured in the sediments of the harbor of Ostia—Rome’s first harbor—show that lead pipes used in the water supply networks of Rome and Ostia were the only source of radiogenic Pb, which, in geologically young central Italy, is the hallmark of urban pollution. High-resolution geochemical, isotopic, and 14C analyses of a sedimentary core from Ostia harbor have allowed us to date the commissioning of Rome’s lead pipe water distribution system to around the second century BC, considerably later than Rome’s first aqueduct built in the late fourth century BC. Even more significantly, the isotopic record of Pb pollution proves to be an unparalleled proxy for tracking the urban development of ancient Rome over more than a millennium, providing a semiquantitative record of the water system’s initial expansion, its later neglect, probably during the civil wars of the first century BC, and its peaking in extent during the relative stability of the early high Imperial period. This core record fills the gap in the system’s history before the appearance of more detailed literary and inscriptional evidence from the late first century BC onward. It also preserves evidence of the changes in the dynamics of the Tiber River that accompanied the construction of Rome’s artificial port, Portus, during the first and second centuries AD",

    "title": "Statistical physics and stromatolite growth: new perspectives on an\n  ancient dilemma",
    "abstract": "This paper outlines our recent attempts to model the growth and form of\nmicrobialites from the perspective of the statistical physics of evolving\nsurfaces. Microbialites arise from the environmental interactions of microbial\ncommunities (microbial mats). The mats evolve over time to form internally\nlaminated organosedimentary structures (stromatolites). Modern day\nstromatolites exist in only a few locations, whereas ancient stromatolitic\nmicrobialites were the only form of life for much of the Earth's history. They\nexisted in a wide variety of growth forms, ranging from almost perfect cones to\nbranched columnar structures. The coniform structures are central to the heated\ndebate on the oldest evidence of life. We proposed a biotic model which\nconsiders the relationship between upward growth of a phototropic or\nphototactic biofilm and mineral accretion normal to the surface. These\nprocesses are sufficient to account for the growth and form of many ancient\nstromatolities. These include domical stromatolites and coniform structures\nwith thickened apical zones typical of Conophyton. More angular coniform\nstructures, similar to the stromatolites claimed as the oldest macroscopic\nevidence of life, form when the photic effects dominate over mineral accretion.Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures.

The authors propose a biotic model that links the upward growth of phototropic/phototactic biofilms with mineral accretion to explain various ancient stromatolite forms, including domical and coniform structures like Conophyton. The study suggests that the balance between photic effects and mineral accretion dictates the resulting morphology, with photic dominance leading to more angular coniform structures.

    "abstract": "Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods with a fossil record extending back\napproximately 450 million years. They exhibit remarkable morphological\nstability over their long evolutionary history, retaining a number of ancestral\narthropod traits, and are often cited as examples of \"living fossils.\" As\narthropods, they belong to the Ecdysozoa}, an ancient super-phylum whose\nsequenced genomes (including insects and nematodes) have thus far shown more\ndivergence from the ancestral pattern of eumetazoan genome organization than\ncnidarians, deuterostomes, and lophotrochozoans. However, much of ecdysozoan\ndiversity remains unrepresented in comparative genomic analyses. Here we use a\nnew strategy of combined de novo assembly and genetic mapping to examine the\nchromosome-scale genome organization of the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus\npolyphemus. We constructed a genetic linkage map of this 2.7 Gbp genome by\nsequencing the nuclear DNA of 34 wild-collected, full-sibling embryos and their\nparents at a mean redundancy of 1.1x per sample. The map includes 84,307\nsequence markers and 5,775 candidate conserved protein coding genes. Comparison\nto other metazoan genomes shows that the L. polyphemus genome preserves\nancestral bilaterian linkage groups, and that a common ancestor of modern\nhorseshoe crabs underwent one or more ancient whole genome duplications (WGDs)\n~ 300 MYA, followed by extensive chromosome fusion",

    "abstract": "The origins of many plant diseases appear to be recent and associated with the rise of domestication, the spread of agriculture or recent global movements of crops. Distinguishing between these possibilities is problematic because of the difficulty of determining rates of molecular evolution over short time frames. Heterochronous approaches using recent and historical samples show that plant viruses exhibit highly variable and often rapid rates of molecular evolution. The accuracy of estimated evolution rates and age of origin can be greatly improved with the inclusion of older molecular data from archaeological material. Here we present the first reconstruction of an archaeological RNA genome, which is of Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV) isolated from barley grain ~750 years of age. Phylogenetic analysis of BSMV that includes this genome indicates the divergence of BSMV and its closest relative prior to this time, most likely around 2000 years ago. However, exclusion of the archaeological data results in an apparently much more recent origin of the virus that postdates even the archaeological sample. We conclude that this viral lineage originated in the Near East or North Africa, and spread to North America and East Asia with their hosts along historical trade routes",

    "abstract": "Historians’ interest in the history of human migrations is not limited to recent years. Migrations had already figured as explanatory factors in connection with cultural and historical change in the work of classical and ancient studies scholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the writings of these scholars, migrations acted as historical landmarks or epochal thresholds and played a key role in the construction of geo‐historical areas. This model has been called “migrationism” and cannot be explained simply on the basis of the history of individual disciplines, but must be seen in its complex interaction with scientific and historical contexts. However, “migrationism” does not relate to fixed political and scientific positions or movements. For this reason, it cannot be explained adequately by using a historically or ideologically based approach. Relying on narratological approaches, this article examines migration narratives that historians of this period used to explain the rise and fall of ancient civilizations. Referring to contemporary historiographical representations of the ancient Near East, it distinguishes three main narratives that are still common today: narratives of foundation, narratives of destruction, and narratives of mixtures. In this sense, analyzing older migration narratives helps us to sharpen the critical view on the genealogy of our own views on the history—and present—of human migrations",

    "abstract": "1. Land-use change is considered one of the most radical and extensive disturbances that have influenced plant distributions and diversity patterns in forest understorey communities in much of Europe and eastern North America. In forests growing on former agricultural land, local species diversity and community differentiation among sites are generally reduced compared to ancient forests (i.e. forests with no historical record of agriculture). Yet, no study has determined how the compositional differences created by former land use change over time as the forest sites recover from former agricultural use.\n2. Here we resurveyed 78 vegetation plots (half of the plots in ancient and half in post-agricultural forest) to demonstrate how three decades of forest development have changed the compositional differences between post-agricultural and ancient forest sites. The impact of land-use history and survey date was tested on two measures of species diversity and two measure of community divergence.\n3. The data indicate that the imprint of former agricultural land use persisted over time, yet not through compositional stability. Parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and post-agricultural forest: the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged, which indicates community drift. The observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly accepted model of community development in post-agricultural forests, i.e. the diversity did not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over time. The changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common, competitive species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species. The source populations of ancient forest species have been gradually depleted, so the recovery of post-agricultural forests becomes even more precarious.\n4. Synthesis. While land-use history is likely to persist as the primary predictor of local species diversity and community divergence, other environmental drivers may additionally structure forest understorey communities and lead to biotic impoverishment and pervasive species reordering on the time scale of only decades",

    "summary": "This study investigated how land-use change, specifically former agricultural use, impacts forest understorey plant distributions and diversity over time. Researchers resurveyed 78 vegetation plots in both ancient and post-agricultural forests over three decades, analyzing species diversity and community divergence. The findings reveal that the imprint of past agriculture persisted, contrary to expectations of recovery and increased diversity. Instead, both forest types experienced parallel vegetation shifts, with decreased species diversity and increased community drift, favoring common, competitive species over ancient forest indicators. This suggests that the recovery of post-agricultural forests is becoming more challenging due to the depletion of ancient forest species."

    "abstract": "When we try to make sense of pictures, what do we gain when we use a particular method - and what might we be missing or even losing? Empirical experimentation on three types of mythological imagery - a Classical Greek pot, a frieze from Hellenistic Pergamon and a second-century CE Roman sarcophagus - enables Katharina Lorenz to demonstrate how theoretical approaches to images (specifically, iconology, semiotics, and image studies) impact the meanings we elicit from Greek and Roman art. A guide to Classical images of myth, and also a critical history of Classical archaeology's attempts to give meaning to pictures, this book establishes a dialogue with the wider field of art history and proposes a new framework for the study of ancient visual culture. It will be essential reading not just for students of classical art history and archaeology, but for anyone interested in the possibilities - and the history - of studying visual culture.\n\n\n\nThis book:\n\n- Proposes a new framework for the study of (ancient) visual culture based on engagement with Greek and Roman mythological imagery, appealing to those seeking to better their understanding of Greek and Roman cultural history.\n\n\n\n- Relates historiography and method development in Classical archaeology and ancient art history to the art history of more modern periods, and will therefore be of interest to readers interested in the Classical world and those concerned with more recent historical periods.\n\n\n\n- Tracks intellectual developments in different contexts and carves out their similarities and differences, speaking to readers from different intellectual backgrounds and familiarising them with broader developments in western European art history",

    "abstract": "One of the attractions of medieval urban history is the fact that major conceptual problems in the field continue to be debated. In a stimulating review article by J.H. Mundy, ’Philip Jones and the medieval Italian city-state‘, J. of European Economic History, 28 (1999), 185–200, one distinguished scholar is taxed for holding views now dismissed by some, but of which he is by no means a unique surviving representative. One of these views assumes a clear distinction between the antique city, supposedly a bureaucratic centre with limited economic functions, and the medieval city, as the home of industrious artisans and nascent capitalism. The image of the non-profit-making ancient town may be overly indebted to the nature of the literary sources and to the prevalent interests of classicists; but, although many would now agree that both the elements in the above equation need qualifying, a more focused comparison is presently lacking, and a fine book is still waiting to be written on the transition from the ancient world to the middle ages in urban history",

    "abstract": "The first discoveries of exoplanets around Sun-like stars have fueled efforts\nto find ever smaller worlds evocative of Earth and other terrestrial planets in\nthe Solar System. While gas-giant planets appear to form preferentially around\nmetal-rich stars, small planets (with radii less than four Earth radii) can\nform under a wide range of metallicities. This implies that small, including\nEarth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the Universe's\nhistory when metals were far less abundant. We report Kepler spacecraft\nobservations of KOI-3158, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of\nthe Galactic thick disk, which hosts five planets with sizes between Mercury\nand Venus. We used asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of\n11.2+/-1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that KOI-3158 formed when the\nUniverse was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest known\nsystem of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have\nformed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8-billion-year history, providing\nscope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.Comment: Submitted to EPJ Web of Conferences, to appear in the Proceedings of\n  the 3rd CoRoT Symposium, Kepler KASC7 joint meeting; 4 pages, 1 figur",

According to Clerk, his translation of Guido delle Colonne’s Historia\ndestructionis Troiae provides vernacular readers access to historical truth that had not\npreviously been available to them. Clerk’s assumption of Guido’s history separates\nhis romance from the historiographic tradition of the vastly influential Geoffrey of\nMonmouth, whose Historia regum Britannie celebrates Britain’s Trojan ancestry and\npromises future glory to the Britons. Rather than venerate Troy as a font of imperial\npower, Guido condemns the martial policy of the Trojans that causes their defeat,\ncharacterizing Troy as a tainted origin of Western civilization. By comparing Clerk’s\ntext with another translation of Guido’s Historia, John Lydgate’s Troy Book, I argue\nthat Clerk’s translational method, which he calls a ‘linking of letters’, reflects a\ncommitment to connecting a destructive past with an English present",

    "summary": "This essay analyzes John Clerk of Whalley's prologue to his late fourteenth-century romance, \"The Destruction of Troy.\" Clerk, acting as translator, historian, and poet, introduces the fall of Troy to medieval English readers. He employs the \"translatio imperii\" fiction, claiming imperial power passed from Troy to Rome to Britain. The study compares Clerk's translation of Guido delle Colonne's \"Historia destructionis Troiae\" with John Lydgate's \"Troy Book.\" The author argues that Clerk's translational method, termed a 'linking of letters,' aimed to connect a destructive ancient past with the English present, differentiating his work from Geoffrey of Monmouth's celebratory historiography."

    "title": "The Storm-Gods of the Ancient Near East: Summary, Synthesis, Recent Studies. Part II",
    "abstract": "In many regions of the ancient Near East, not least in Upper Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia where agriculture relied mainly on rainfall, storm-gods ranked among the most prominent gods in the local panthea or were even regarded as divine kings, ruling over the gods and bestowing kingship on the human ruler. While the Babylonian and Assyrian storm-god never held the highest position among the gods, he too belongs to the group of 'great gods' through most periods of Mesopotamian history. Given the many cultural contacts and the longevity of traditions in the ancient Near East only a study that takes into account all relevant periods, regions and text-groups can further our understanding of the different ancient Near Eastern storm-gods. The study Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens by the present author (2001) tried to tackle the problems involved, basing itself primarily on the textual record and excluding the genuinely Anatolian storm-gods from the study. Given the lack of handbooks, concordances and thesauri in our field, the book is necessarily heavily burdened with materials collected for the first time. Despite comprehensive indices, the long lists and footnotes as well as the lack of an overall synthesis make the study not easily accessible, especially outside the German-speaking community. In 2003 Alberto Green published a comprehensive monograph entitled The Storm-God in the Ancient Near East whose aims are more ambitious than those of Wettergottgestalten: All regions of the ancient Near East—including a chapter on Yahwe as a storm-god—are taken into account, and both textual and iconographic sources are given equal space. Unfortunately this book, which was apparently finished and submitted to the publisher before Wettergottgestalten came to its author's attention, suffers from some serious flaws with regard to methodology, philology and the interpretation of texts and images. In presenting the following succinct overview I take the opportunity to make up for the missing synthesis in Wettergottgestalten and to provide some additions and corrections where necessary. It is hoped that this synthesis can also serve as a response to the history of ancient Near Eastern storm-gods as outlined by A. Green",

    "abstract": "To judge from the public voice and countenance of religion in America at least, there is a preoccupation in religion with happiness at the expense of meaning. But between the two poles of happiness and meaning there is considerable distance. This chapter accepts the problem of meaning as more urgent than the problem of happiness. For over against the hopeful prescriptions for the integration of the personality and of social life through religion there stands the experience of disintegration of the structure of past confidence. Desperately, theologians wrestle with ancient symbols to wrest from them new significance or reference, or attempt to revivify their lost meaning and powers of evocation. In these critical times theological thought attempts to referee the contest between the lost soul and the powerful chaos of world history. In an intellectual landscape scarred by war, diplomatic failure, economic uncertainty, and a wide variety of psychic traumata, theologians probe the private egos, society, and even language itself to reestablish meaning.

    "abstract": "The California vole, Microtus californicus, restricted to habitat patches where water is available nearly year-round, is a remnant of the mesic history of the southern Great Basin and Mojave deserts of eastern California. The history of voles in this region is a model for species-edge population dynamics through periods of climatic change. We sampled voles from the eastern deserts of California and examined variation in the mitochondrial cytb gene, three nuclear intron regions, and across 12 nuclear microsatellite markers. Samples are allocated to two mitochondrial clades: one associated with southern California and the other with central and northern California. The limited mtDNA structure largely recovers the geographical distribution, replicated by both nuclear introns and microsatellites. The most remote population, Microtus californicus scirpensis at Tecopa near Death Valley, was the most distinct. This population shares microsatellite alleles with both mtDNA clades, and both its northern clade nuclear introns and southern clade mtDNA sequences support a hybrid origin for this endangered population. The overall patterns support two major invasions into the desert through an ancient system of riparian corridors along streams and lake margins during the latter part of the Pleistocene followed by local in&nbsp;situ divergence subsequent to late Pleistocene and Holocene drying events. Changes in current water resource use could easily remove California voles from parts of the desert landscape",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases of plants, almost half of which are caused by viruses, are recognized as a growing threat to global food security. However, little is known about the evolutionary processes and ecological factors that underlie the emergence and success of viruses that have caused past epidemics. With technological advances in the field of ancient DNA and RNA, it is now possible to sequence historical viral genomes, which provides us direct access to the dimension of time in evolutionary studies. Herbarium collections are an enormous source of dated, identified and well-preserved material that can be used to elucidate the emergence and evolutionary history of viral plant pathogens. Geminiviruses are responsible for many of the emerging plant diseases worldwide with a major economic impact on food crops such as cassava, which are a vital source of dietary calories in many sub-Saharan African countries. Their high potential for evolution, with high rates of mutation and recombination, makes such viruses an ideal model for understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary processes associated with viral emergence. Our proof of concept study investigated whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be used to reconstruct a complete geminivirus DNA genome from a herbarium sample despite the existence of post-mortem nucleic acid damage. Using a metagenomics approach based on the high-throughput sequencing of siRNA, we obtained a siRNA database from cassava leaf samples presenting typical symptoms of cassava mosaic disease that were collected in 1928 from Madagascar and 1968 from Cameroon, and then stored in the National Museum of Natural History herbarium in Paris. Our preliminary results demonstrate our ability to reconstruct the almost complete sequence of bipartite begomoviruses in particular from a 90-year-old herbarium specimen. These sequences are now used in phylogenetic, comparative genomic and phylogeographic studies to elucidate the emergence and evolutionary history of this important crop pathogen",

    "abstract": "University of Technology, Sydney. Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology.This thesis introduces believable conversational agents as an engaging and motivational learning tool for teaching ancient history and culture in virtual worlds.\r\nTraditional approaches are lacking engagement, interactivity and socialisation, features that are of tremendous importance to modern students (digital natives). At the same time, modern 3D visualisations primarily focus on the design side of the given space and neglect the actual inhabitants of these ancient places. As a consequence, in such historical or cultural 3D visualisations it is difficult to engage the students in the learning process and to keep track of students' learning progress. Furthermore, this approach neglects the knowledge carriers (inhabitants of the ancient site) which are an important part of a particular culture and played an important role in significant historical events.\r\nEmbodied conversational agents envisaged by this thesis for teaching ancient history and culture must be believable as they act in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments such as 3D Virtual Worlds with both human and autonomous agent participants. In these virtual environments participants behave autonomously and frequently interact with each other and with software agents. Therefore, embodied conversational agents must know their surroundings, be aware of their own state in the virtual environment and possess a detailed knowledge of their own interactions as well as the interactions of other participants. We label such agent abilities as \"awareness believability\" and develop the necessary theoretical background and the formalisation of this concept. We also discuss the I2B (Interactive, Intelligent and Believable) framework that implements awareness believability using the combination of the Virtual Institutions technology, the AIML engine and the visualisation layer of Virtual Worlds.\r\nThrough a detailed literature review on virtual agents' believability we identified the ability to continuously learn new conversational skills as another important aspect of being believable. Thus, this thesis also explains how AIML specific rules and virtual agents' interactions with subject matter experts help to dynamically improve the conversational corpus of virtual agents via imitation learning.\r\nTo validate the impact of supplying agents with awareness believability we conducted a number of case studies specific to the domain of ancient history and culture. The studies confirmed that the identified awareness features are indeed making the agents perceived as more believable. Furthermore, the studies provide important evidence in favour of using virtual agents for improving the knowledge of students in the domain of ancient history and culture",

Addressing limitations of traditional methods, the research proposes and formalizes \"awareness believability\" for agents operating in dynamic virtual environments. It discusses the I2B (Interactive, Intelligent and Believable) framework, which integrates Virtual Institutions, the AIML engine, and Virtual Worlds for implementation. The study also explores improving agents' conversational skills through imitation learning. Case studies confirmed that awareness features enhance agent believability and support their effectiveness in improving students' knowledge of ancient history and culture, focusing on interactive learning and socialisation."

It surveys scholarly discussions focusing on their representation and use, contributing to debates about Asherah/asherah in monarchic Judah. The study aims to understand the popularity of JPFs in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE by drawing on Antonio Gramsci's concepts of cultural hegemony and ideology. It suggests JPFs were part of a complex cultural discourse, resisting, adopting, and fusing ideologies, and highlights the multifaceted impact of Assyrian imperialism on Judean culture and ethnic identity."

From these studies, it has been possible to distinguish between pre- and post-domestic genetic differentiation, supporting previous assertions from archaeological studies and, in some cases, revealing novel aspects of the demographic history of cattle.\n\nAnalyses of genetic material retrieved from the remains of extinct ancestral wild cattle have also added valuable layers of information pertaining to cattle domestic origins; however, information from these investigations have, in general, been limited to small, variable portions of the mitochondrial genome owing to technical challenges associated with the retrieval and amplification of ancient DNA.\n\nIn recent years, however, new high-throughput, massively parallel genomics technology platforms, such as single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have provided a new impetus to the studies of genetic variation in extant and ancient cattle.\n\nArrays of SNP have facilitated high-resolution genetic surveys of global cattle populations and detection of ancient and recent genomic selective sweeps. Next-generation sequencing analyses of modern and ancient cattle hold great promise for identifying and cataloging of pre- and post-domestication patterns of genomic variation and correlating this with natural and artificial selection processes",

Pico showed interest in ancient monists. He commented that only Xenophanes’ One is the One simply, while Parmenides’ One is not the absolute One, but the oneness of Being. Melissus’ One is in extreme correspondence to that of Xenophanes. As for Xenophanes, Pico seems to have fallen victim of ancient sources, who referred to Xenophanes and Parmenides as members of the Eleatic “tribe”. In the case of Parmenides Pico draws mainly on the Platonic dialogues Parmenides and Sophist and not on intermediaries such as the Neoplatonists and other commentators. Despite of Pico’s knowledge of Empedocles’ philosophy, it is worth noticing that Pico was also strongly influenced by the medieval kabbalistic literature and the pseudo Empedocles. While Neoplatonists, such as Proclus, commented Empedocles and interpreted him according to the Neoplatonic spectrum, Pico’s appreciation of the philosophy of Empedocles was mediated through Arab and Jewish mysticism. Pico counted among his sources the Pre-Socratics, but the way he read them was not always direct and consistent. He intentionally chose to interpret them through the spectrum of intermediaries such as the ancient Commentators, the Neoplatonists, the Arabs and Jews mystics",

This paper will be useful for researchers, teachers and learners of Greek History at University level, but is also designed to help 6th-form teachers and students in the UK with the study of these two inscriptions, which are set as source material for the “Relations between Greek states and between Greek and non-Greek states, 492-404 BC” period study under the OCR specification for A-level Ancient History (H407, for first assessment in 2019; LACTOR4 1.78 and 138).

If\n\nwe cannot trust our digital surrogates of texts, can we trust the readings from them?\n\nHow do scholars acknowledge the quality of digitised images of texts? Furthermore,\n\nthis leads us to the type of discussions of representation that have been present in\n\nClassical texts since Plato: digitisation can be considered as an alternative form of\n\nrepresentation, bringing to the modern debate of the use of digital technology in Classics\n\nthe familiar theories of mimesis (imitation) and ekphrasis (description): the conversion\n\nof visual evidence into explicit descriptions of that information, stored in computer\n\nfiles in distinct linguistic terms, with all the difficulties of conversion understood in the\n\nekphratic process. The community has not yet considered what becoming dependent\n\non digital texts means for the field, both in practical and theoretical terms.

    "abstract": "Grecian sculpture has been the subject of investigation for centuries. More recently, however, emphasis in the field of Art History on the politics of gender and sexuality portrayal have opened new avenues for investigation of those old statues. In depicting gender, Ancient Greek statuary can veer towards the non-binary, with the most striking examples being works depicting Hermaphroditos and ‘his’ bodily form. Yet even within the binary, there are complications. Depictions of the goddess Artemis are chief among these complications of the binary, with even more contradiction, subtext, and varied interpretation than representations of Amazons. The numerous ways Artemis has been portrayed over the years highlight her multifarious aspects, but often paint a contradictory portrait of her femininity. Is she the wild mother? The asexual huntress? Or is she a tempting virgin, whose purity is at risk? Depictions of her in sculptural form, deliberately composed, offer answers. Though as separate depictions they sometimes contradict one another, as a whole, they reveal just how Artemis the female was thought of",

    "abstract": "This report presents the results of a survey into the current use of ancient woodland indicator species lists in the UK. The idea of using species particularly vascular plants as indicators of ancient woodlands can be dated back to the 1970s and the work of Peterken. Since then a wide number of lists of Ancient Woodland Indicators (AWIs)have been produced, some based on expert opinions, some utilising field surveys, others adapted from existing lists. Recently developed lists, e.g. the lists for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been based on either robust reviews of existing lists, and/or expert opinion and/or field surveys and statistical analysis. Concerns however have been expressed regarding the use of lists and these concerns appear to be supported by the uncritical use of indicator species in recent planning inquiries, e.g. not recognising that indicators are indicators and considering them to be the key value of a woodland. A survey was undertaken of relevant individuals working in biological record centres, local authorities and key agencies across the UK. The survey sought to identify what lists of Ancient Woodland Indicators are currently in use, where possible to determine the methods used in developing these lists. The survey also sought to assess the awareness of ancient woodland indicator lists and review the ways in which these were used. A total of 419 questionnaires were sent out; a response rate of 11% was obtained. Follow up phone conversations were held with key individuals involved in developing ancient woodland indicator lists. Responses were received from all counties excluding: Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Essex, Huntingdonshire, Middlesex, Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Wiltshire and Worcestershire. In addition, the Lancashire respondent stated there was no AWI list for Lancashire. The key findings of the survey were: • There is a wide variety of lists of Ancient Woodland Indicators lists available covering most of the UK. • Most individuals using indicator lists are unaware of the methods used to produce the lists and therefore of their robustness. Some key stakeholders are unaware of the existence of indicator lists in their area. • Attitudes to ancient woodland indicator lists are variable, as is their use. • Few lists use species thresholds or weightings in determining whether a site is ancient, several lists are currently under review. • There are over 200 species listed on the various Ancient Woodland Indicators lists, few species are common to more than a quarter of the lists",

    "title": "The origins of intensive marine fishing in medieval Europe: the English evidence",
    "abstract": "The catastrophic impact of fishing pressure on species such as cod and herring is well documented. However, the antiquity of their intensive exploitation has not been established. Systematic catch statistics are only available for ca. 100 years, but large-scale fishing industries existed in medieval Europe and the expansion of cod fishing from the fourteenth century (first in Iceland, then in Newfoundland) played an important role in the European colonization of the Northwest Atlantic. History has demonstrated the scale of these late medieval and post-medieval fisheries, but only archaeology can illuminate earlier practices. Zooarchaeological evidence shows that the clearest changes in marine fishing in England between AD 600 and 1600 occurred rapidly around AD 1000 and involved large increases in catches of herring and cod. Surprisingly, this revolution predated the documented post-medieval expansion of England's sea fisheries and coincided with the Medieval Warm Period-when natural herring and cod productivity was probably low in the North Sea. This counterintuitive discovery can be explained by the concurrent rise of urbanism and human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. The search for 'pristine' baselines regarding marine ecosystems will thus need to employ medieval palaeoecological proxies in addition to recent fisheries data and early modern historical records",

The significance of this problematic is highlighted by the increasing amount of direct and indirect evidence of the role played by a number of early Jewish and Christian\r\npseudepigraphic works in the formation of medieval Christian dualist cosmogonic, cosmological, satanological,\r\nChristological and biblical history traditions. The preliminary survey of medieval dualist\r\nconceptions of biblical Paradise shows also once more that the doctrinal evidence for Bogomilism\r\nand Catharism is too complex and polyvalent to be defined or ignored apriori as representing medieval\r\nheresiological constructs drawing on earlier heresiological texts and stereotypes. The material examined in the article shows that the text-critical treatment of the primary sources to first establish\r\nthe most plausible literary and theological provenance of the respective teachings attributed to medieval\r\nChristian dualist groups or individuals still remains indispensable to the study of medieval heresy and needs to precede the application of models and approaches drawn from contemporary\r\nanthropological and sociological theory to the source material",

It aims to initiate discussion on their theological and literary provenance, highlighting the influence of early Jewish and Christian pseudepigraphic works on dualist cosmogonic, cosmological, satanological, and Christological traditions. The preliminary survey reveals the complexity of doctrinal evidence for Bogomilism and Catharism, suggesting they are not merely heresiological constructs. The study emphasizes the necessity of text-critical treatment of primary sources to establish the provenance of these teachings before applying contemporary anthropological and sociological theories to medieval heresy."

    "abstract": "During the pivotal November 2002 football game of Arkansas vs. Georgia in the SEC conference championship, the Georgia marching band struck up their defensive rallying song. Instead of a typical  defense  song, the band played an excerpt of the Gregorian Sequence Dies Irae ( Day of Wrath\\u27\\u27) from the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass. Drastically dissociated from its original medieval milieu, this musical Sequence still manages to elicit the same effect of fear and foreboding nearly a thousand years later. Precisely because of its deep musical and cultural roots, the Dies Irae occupies a significant place in history, closely intertwined from early on with the medieval folk motif Totentanz ( Dance of Death ), widely depicted in medieval art, and dramatically revived in 19th century music, art, and literature. This multi-disciplinary study focuses on the history of art and music of these two medieval themes during their development, and then moves on to study them in 19th century culture. Specifically, the manipulation of the original Gregorian chant and the incorporation of the idea of a medieval dance are analyzed in the music of Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and Camille Saint-Saens. Numerous other contextual links are explored as well, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Victor Hugo, Henri Cazalis, William Blake, and Alfred Rethel, all of whom created 19th century artistic or literary masterpieces derived from the thematic seeds of the Dies Irae and the Totentanz. Although neither of these ideas endured in their original form during the Romantic era, the inherently compelling nature of these themes that center on the macabre but inevitable end of life captivated the Romantic geniuses and continue to intrigue us to this day",

Malory depicted the French wars under the guise of Arthur's sixth-century campaign against Rome, and Arthur was key to medieval and Renaissance representations of sovereignty and resistance. One critical view suggests that by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Arthur became an inconvenient myth, retaining poetic and propagandistic potential but scoffed at by serious scholars. The Reformation and the rise of antiquarianism engendered suspicion of medieval sources, and Arthur and Brutus were undone by the rise of Anglo-Saxon studies. Yet Arthur maintained momentum even as myth morphed from history to poetry, and writers such as Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare still found purchase in the legend. Looked at closely, Milton's disparaging of Arthur appears less absolute, refashioning as it does Malory's Arthurian political allegory",

    "abstract": "This paper explores an example of ‘reformist’ hagiographic production in early eleventh-century Lotharingia by focusing on the Life of St Roding of Beaulieu, a small monastery in the diocese of Verdun. Until recently, this text was interpreted exclusively in terms of the scant information it provides on this institution’s early medieval history and in terms of its ideological message regarding monastic discipline and leadership. By integrating the redaction of this text into the then-current regional geography and political context, this paper proposes a new approach to its interpretation and to the understanding of Beaulieu’s ‘monastic reform’ in general. Close analysis of the narrative reveals that its redaction was inspired by specific issues relating to local and regional politics in the mid-1010s, and that parts of the institution’s recent history were allegorically veiled behind the portrayal of Roding. However, rapid changes in power relationships rendered those aspects of the text outdated within a few years. This raises significant questions regarding the long-term relevance of such hidden stories and the degree to which their various ideological, political and other messages remained accessible to medieval audiences",

    "abstract": "Swordsmanship emerged as a new field of knowledge in early modern Japan (1600–1868), a time of relative peace. During the most violent periods of Japanese history, the latter half of the medieval period (1185–1600), samurai conducted warfare mostly on horseback, using the bow and arrow, or by leading massive armies filled with soldiers who used pikes, halberds, and even firearms. In this paper, I will trace the origins of early modern swordsmanship to the late 16th century during the transition between the medieval and early modern periods, when teachers of swordsmanship and their sword ‘styles’ first appeared in texts. Of these texts I will focus on ‘The Military Mirror of Kai’, purportedly written during the late 16th century, and a widely-read text among samurai of the early modern period. A mix of fact and fiction, the ‘Mirror’ became a source of fantasy and inspiration for samurai and non-samurai alike. It is also the earliest source of writing about swordsmanship, which was influenced by, and grew alongside, other medieval cultural arts such as Noh theater and tea ceremony",

The pessimistic Christian response to the fall of Rome in AD 410, epitomized in Augustine's City of God, affected the development of the later medieval city to a degree which has yet, even now, to be fully appreciated. In the Christian city of the Middle Ages the divinity was normally confined to the sanctuaries of his churches, whose topographical prominence and harmonious proportions made manifest an otherwise hidden spiritual order. Outside the cloister gates, disorder reigned: a general lack of planning revealed the meaninglessness of the outward, secular life. This dichotomy between an inner world of spirit and a public world of transient matter was embodied in the recurrent tensions between spiritual and secular space which ran as a motif throughout the history of medieval towns. Modern studies which have emphasized (not, of course, without reason) the secular political and economic power of ecclesiastical institutions in the medieval city have perhaps distracted attention unduly from the real differences of ethos which, within the town, distinguished religious space from that of the surrounding lay world",

Wathima and Tabari, the eleventh century Tales of the Prophets by Tha'labi, the twelfth century folkloric collection of Kisa'i, along with Ibn 'Asakir's History of Damascus, the thirteenth century world history by Ibn al-Athir, and the fourteenth century historiographical work by Ibn Kathir. These various works are viewed not as any particular stage in the development of a genre, but as variations on a (Qur'anic) theme, and the avenue of medieval historiographers and storytellers is utilised as a bridge to explore various possible interpretations of the Qur'anic passage. Historiographers and storytellers provide us with an illustration of how lessons of admonition implied in the Qur'anic text were perceived in medieval Islamic society. They also, as will become clear, provide a picture of Solomon that is consistent with the Qur'anic figure as a whole",

    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;“A woman who takes up devilish ways and plays a male role in coupling with\n\nanother woman is most vile in My sight, and so is she who subjects herself to\n\nsuch a one in this evil deed…..”1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This statement, made by Hildegard of Bingen is representative of much of the vitriol the\n\nmedieval church liked to produce in response to same sex sexual activity. Indeed, even for\n\nas innovative (and on occasions heretical) an author as Hildegard there was neither space\n\nnor any evidence of her desire to do other than uphold traditional approaches to two\n\nwomen having sex.2 In the face of such prejudice it is hard not to wonder whether the\n\nmedieval church has anything positive to offer the queer ecclesial community. Of course, by\n\nimplication this quote suggests that queer folk existed in the distant past and are not just a\n\nfigment of our fertile (if not furtive), libidinous, post‐modernist imaginations. Indeed, this\n\nquote indicates the existence of not only woman to woman sex, but also role playing of a\n\ntype that sounds (comfortingly or disquieteningly dependent on your personal view point)\n\nlike the butch/femme dichotomy. Obviously, this is a translation from Latin and linguistically\n\nat least, conveys an inherently post‐medieval reading of the text. However, it is hard to\n\nknow how a literal interpretation of this particular text would differ. It clearly implies same\n\nsex coupling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this paper I wish to elaborate on why and how medieval church history can be used to\n\nbenefit of the queer community and those whom identify as its ministers. To do this, I have\n\nbroken the paper into three key areas: firstly, theoretical frameworks; secondly, the\n\npractical implications of these frameworks for queer ministry; and thirdly, a case study of\n\nusing the historical imaginary and what it suggests as areas for exploration in queer\n\ntheology.&lt;/p&gt",

    "abstract": "Historians have long tended to define medieval Scottish society in terms of interactions between ethnic groups. This approach was developed over the course of the long nineteenth century, a formative period for the study of medieval Scotland. At that time, many scholars based their analysis upon scientific principles, long since debunked, which held that medieval 'peoples' could only be understood in terms of 'full ethnic packages'. This approach was combined with a positivist historical narrative that defined Germanic Anglo-Saxons and Normans as the harbingers of advances of Civilisation. While the prejudices of that era have largely faded away, the modern discipline still relies all too often on a dualistic ethnic framework. This is particularly evident in a structure of periodisation that draws a clear line between the 'Celtic' eleventh century and the 'Norman' twelfth. Furthermore, dualistic oppositions based on ethnicity continue, particularly in discussions of the law, kingship, lordship and religion",

I use a re- examination of the full range of reported medieval mystical experiences (both in the apophatic tradition, which excludes or denigrates embodied states, and in the affective tradition, which treats such states as fully mystical) to demonstrate how a better understanding of the historical medieval mystic tradition can serve as a valuable complement to ongoing philosophical discussions of religious and mystical experience",

    "title": "The Orality of a Silent Age: The Place of Orality in Medieval Studies",
    "abstract": "'The Orality of a Silent Age: The Place of Orality in Medieval Studies' uses a brief survey of current work on Old English poetry as the point of departure for arguing that although useful, the concepts of orality and literacy have, in medieval studies, been extended further beyond their literal referents of spoken and written communication than is heuristically useful. Recent emphasis on literate methods and contexts for the writing of our surviving Anglo-Saxon poetry, in contradistinction to the previous emphasis on oral ones, provides the basis for this criticism. Despite a significant amount of revisionist work, the concept of orality remains something of a vortex into which a range of only party related issues have been sucked: authorial originality/communal property; impromptu composition/meditated composition; authorial and audience alienation/immediacy. The relevance of orality to these issues is not in dispute; the problem is that they do not vary along specifically oral/literate axes. The article suggests that this is symptomatic of a wider modernist discourse in medieval studies whereby modern, literate society is (implicitly) contrasted with medieval, oral society: the extension of the orality/literacy axis beyond its literal reference has to some extent facilitated the perpetuation of an earlier contrast between primitivity and modernity which deserves still to be questioned and disputed. Pruning back our conceptions of the oral and the literate to their stricter denotations, we might hope to see more clearly what areas of medieval studies would benefit from alternative interpretations",

The Pereyaslav fortress, strategically located between the Alt and Trubezh rivers, integrated traditional Old Rus' wooden-earthen defenses with elements of a bastion system. Subsequent reinforcements by Janusz Ostrozkyi and Janusz Zaslavskyi in the early 17th century further enhanced its protective capabilities. The fortress complex, spanning 1500 meters, housed the voivode's residence, a gunpowder depot, potash storage, provisions, and military arsenal, defended by mercenary garrisons.

While traditional national histories laid the foundation, the new British and Irish historiography has teased out many of the nuances arising from the interaction between the three kingdoms or four nations of Britain and Ireland. This approach has produced much scholarly work for both the medieval and early modern periods, although modern historians are still grappling with attempts to write a genuinely British history.1 For the early modern period in particular, the \"three kingdoms\" debate of the seventeenth century has advanced awareness of the complexity of regal union and the problems associated with one king ruling three distinct kingdoms. It is within this wider British context that James VI and I's efforts to integrate his three kingdoms need to be viewed. Although James's \"earnist dispositioun to perfyte that Union\"- brought about by his succession to the English throne on 1603-was thwarted by both the English and Scottish parliaments, James could not afford to govern either kingdom in isolation",

Through an analysis of the Historia Brittonum’s textual tradition and Welsh knowledge of early Roman history and medieval ethnic groups, this article establishes that Albanus was added to the Historia Brittonum in the late ninth or early tenth century as an ancestral figure for the new kingdom of Alba in northern Britain. This was potentially a result of shared political situations in Gwynedd, Alba (formerly Pictland) and Strathclyde in relation to Scandinavian power at this time, which encouraged contacts and the spread of Alba-based ideology to Gwynedd. The later development of this idea and its significance in Alba itself, Geoffrey of Monmouth's account and English claims to supremacy over Scotland are also traced",

    "abstract": "The role of the Book of Hours in female lay devotional life during the late Middle Ages has been investigated and analyzed by many scholars and art historians over the course of the past century. The general consensus has been that semi-literate medieval women valued these books greatly as instructional manuals on how to attain salvation, using the images contained within as spiritual aids meant to encourage individual contemplation and pious recitation. Prayers for mediation, protection, and guidance featured prominently within these books and many historians of both genders have come to the conclusion that Books of Hours were a source of comfort and spiritual nourishment for women living in a male-dominated and male-oriented world.

Challenging traditional views that these books were solely instructional manuals for salvation, the analysis considers how images and prayers also supported dynastic and familial aspirations. By examining historical perspectives and specific examples like Jeanne d'Evreux, the paper argues that Books of Hours served as unique devotional guides, encouraging pious and obedient lives in pursuit of various forms of salvation beyond individual redemption. Key concepts include medieval women, lay devotion, religious imagery, and societal roles."

    "abstract": "Race theorists have been unable to reach a consensus regarding the basic historical question, “is ‘race’ modern?” I argue that this is partly because the question itself is ambiguous. There is not really one question that race scholars are answering, but at least six. First, is the concept of race modern? Second, is there a modern concept of race that is distinct from earlier race concepts? Third, are “races” themselves modern? Fourth, are racialized groups modern? Fifth, are the means and methods associated with racialization modern? And sixth, are the meanings attached to racialized traits modern? Because these questions have different answers, the debate about the historical origins of “race” cannot be resolved unless they are distinguished. I will explain the ways in which “race” is and is not modern by answering these questions, thereby offering a resolution to a seemingly intractable problem",

    "title": "Marion most bold : feminine transgression in the greenwood",
    "abstract": "In my project, I focus on the role and depiction of women found in the Robin Hood greenwood: specifically, those of Maid Marian. Maid Marian rarely appears in early Robin Hood texts, and especially not in a capacity in which she herself speaks, so it is striking that today she has become almost as synonymous with the greenwood in Robin Hood tales as the man himself. Indeed, one of the rare instances in which Marian plays a lead role occurs in the seventeenth-century ballad “Robin Hood and Maid Marian,” which appears in only one manuscript, after the original Robin Hood ballads of the Middle Ages, and does not seem to have been popular. This seventeenth-century ballad allots Maid Marian an agency typically reserved only for Robin’s merry men. Though I agree that Marian exhibits certain transgressive behaviors, especially in “Robin Hood and Maid Marian,” by the end of Robin Hood texts—medieval, early modern, or otherwise—though the space of the greenwood allows a certain level of freedom for the men in the texts, the “good” women in the Robin Hood texts remain noble ladies who still act as they ought to even though they live outside the confines of civilized society. The same social rules of urban society continue to apply to them, and even in the few cases where the women get to demonstrate more traditionally masculine qualities, they still must end up back in their proper role at the end of the Robin Hood ballad or play.Englis",

    "abstract": "A pályázat a középkori Székelyföld történetének és régészetének monografikus igényű kutatására vállalkozott. A munka három témakör köré csoportosult:   I. Egy, a közelmúltban feltárt, rendkívül gazdag leletanyagot rejtő, 15-16. századi székelykeresztúri udvarház monografikus feldolgozása elkészült és 2008-ban nyomtatásban megjelent. A monográfia az udvarházak és ezek leletei, különösképpen kályhacsempéi és tüzelőberendezései elemzésén túlmenően a középkori székelyföldi nemesség kérdését is áttekintette. E témakörben külön tanulmány is készült. A székelyföldi várakról és védelmi célra felhasznált barlangokról több tanulmány is megjelent (Sófalvi András, Székelyudvarhely).  II. A késő középkori, kora újkori csíksomlyói ferences kolostorra vonatkozó kéziratos források (oklevelek, számadáskönyvek és leltárak, elbeszélő források) kiadása már a sajtó alá rendezéshez közeledik (Muckenhaupt Erzsébet, Csíkszereda).  III. A pályázat alapvető célját képező, a a középkori Székelyföld régészetét és történetét felölelő monográfia kézirata három részből áll: 1) több fejezetre oszló történeti-régészeti összefoglalás, terjedelmes illusztrációs anyaggal (Benkő Elek); 2) a székelyföldi középkori állatcsontanyag vizsgálata és értékelése (Gál Erika, Budapest); 3) A középkori Székelyföld embertani anyagának teljességre törekvő feldolgozása (Fóthi Erzsébet, Bernert Zsolt, Hajdu Tamás, Budapest). A kötet legfontosabb megállapításai magyarul, illetve németül külön is megjelentek (Benkő Elek).  |  The project aspired to process the medieval history and archaeology of the Szekler Region in eastern Transylvania. The major themes were assembled in three fields:   I. Working up a medieval manor house excavated in the last years at Cristuru Secuiesc, a monograph was published in 2008, which inclused, in addition to the treatment of different types of manor houses and their findings  a  survey on medieval nobility of the Szekler Region. About medieval castles and caves converted to defensive purposes several publications were elaborated (András  Sófalvi).  II. The transcript and annotation of late medieval and early modern written sources (documents, accounts, consriptions and chronicles) of the franciscan friary of Csíksomlyó is in the final stage before publication (Erzsébet Muckenhaupt).  III. The manuscript of a comprehensive book about the history and archaeology of the Szekler Region contains threee great parts: 1) a large study, divided into several chapters  on different historical and archaeological problems from the the much-disputed issues of the early history and 'origin' of the Szeklers untill the 16th-17th centuries, including an instructive case study of  sedes (village law court) Aranyos (Elek Benkő), 2) the working up of animal bones of medieval villages, market-towns, castles and manor houses (Erika Gál) and 3) the analysis of the complete medieval anthropological material of the Szekler Region (Erzsébet Fóthi, Zsolt Bernert, Tamás Hajdu)",

    "abstract": "Through the rich Christian tradition in Macedonia from the early Christian, medieval and up to the modern period numerous churches and monasteries were built, where all forms of development of spiritual and cultural life took place. A historically remarkable location is Lesnovo Monastery, which has survived until today during almost one thousand years of spiritual and cultural tradition in Macedonia. The oldest indirect and legendary sources point to the conclusion that the original construction of the monastic church in Lesnovo should be moved to the period of the eleventh century, when from 1018 onwards, after the fall of Samuil\\u27s Slavic reign on the territory of Macedonia, the Byzantine state, political, and church protectorate was restored. As a consequence of the resistance to the restored Byzantine spiritual protectorate and the suppression of the established Slavic church tradition in this northeastern part of Macedonia, the anachoretic monasticism was revived, and as a reflection of the rising cult to the venerable hermit, St. Gavril of Lesnovo, the Lesnovo monastery was also affirmed. Its history directly reflects all the forms of spiritual and cultural tradition in Macedonia. In 2017, when the jubilee, the fiftieth anniversary of the restoration of the autocephaly of the Ohrid Archbishopric (1967-2017) as the Macedonian Orthodox Church - Ohrid Archbishopric is celebrated, the former abbot of the Lesnovo monastery Father Gabriel of Mt. Athos and Bishop of Velika was canonized as a saint (†12 January 1990). This blessed Christian act enriched the 10-century long spiritual tradition of the Lesnovo Monastery with the glory and honor of the holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, of the venerable hermit Gavril of Lesnovo and of the Holy Bishop of Velika, the venerable Gavril Svetogorac (of Lesnovo)",

    "summary": "This article challenges the persistent view that Old English texts were primarily written for a lay audience with limited Latin knowledge. The author argues that statements within these texts about their audience should be interpreted as rhetorical devices rather than literal accounts. This re-evaluation has significant implications for understanding the motivations behind writers' use of Old English and their approaches to vernacular translation. By exploring figures like Ælfric and scholarly perspectives, the research sheds light on the confidence Anglo-Saxon writers had in Old English as a medium for scholarly and religious discourse, on par with Latin, influencing our understanding of medieval literature and language."

The Thomistic synthesis, with its stress on reason and how reason could prove the existence of God, was thought by many, including St. Bonaventura (1221-1274), to press too far the rational side of religion and thus to detract from the other side, which emphasizes the free g~it of faith, intuitive insight, and mystical experience. This rational emphasis, thought Bonaventura, could lead to intellectual pride and arrogance.

Bonaventura, influenced by Augustinian and Neoplatonic thought, emphasized the free gift of faith, intuitive insight, and mystical experience, contrasting with the reliance on reason to prove God's existence. The work explores how Bonaventura's views, particularly in \"The Journey of the Mind to God,\" highlight aspects of religious experience beyond rationality, while also stressing his adherence to orthodox Church teachings. It discusses the potential for intellectual pride in rationalism and the dangers of mystics straying from ecclesiastical discipline, contributing to the understanding of religious diversity in the High Middle Ages."

These early modern sources are based on oral traditions of Paradeśi Jews in Cochin, who view the majority of Kerala Jews as inferior.

This article reconstructs Jewish history in premodern Kerala solely based on premodern travelogues and literature on the one hand and on historical documents in Old Malayalam, Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic on the other hand. Sources of the early modern period are then examined for tracing the origins of the Shingly myth, arguing that the incorporation of the Shingly legend into the historiography of Kerala Jews was affected by contacts with European Jews in the Age of Discoveries rather than being a reflection of historical events",

This period in Malta was to see the Islands come under the influence of the Byzantine Empire encompassing the period prior to the ninth century; the Arab dominance starting in AD 870 and lasting until their formal expulsion in the mid-13th century; and the Latin phase of the late 13th century to the early 16th century when the islands were ceded to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. The documentary sources dated to before the 14th century are rather scanty and often limited to ecclesiastical and political matters.

In each case, Tolkien rewrites the original so that sorrow is transformed into happiness in Tolkien’s new versions.

    "summary": "This article examines twentieth-century criticisms of Cajetan's theory of analogy in \"De Nominum Analogia,\" which argue that medieval Aristotelian semantic assumptions regarding discrete 'concepts' and propositional meaning are inadequate for complex human discourse. The author argues that these criticisms are unfounded when considering Cajetan's semantic principles and hermeneutic practice. The study defends Cajetan's work and clarifies philosophical alternatives within the traditional Aristotelian semantic framework, concluding that Cajetan's approach, while conceptualist and compositionalist, is also organicist, where the meaning of parts is determined by interpretation and contextual attention."

Joining these modes, Gower’s revision of Narcissus questions our notions of historiography through showing us an example of a queer, transgender character and his struggles with heteronormative expectations—demonstrating that the medieval is not so disconnected from the modern",

This suggests the Ottonian Sibyl had a less distinct moment of creation than usually assumed, being a product of independent interpolators adding to its late antique core over a long period without a common purpose.

    "abstract": "All art historians who are interested in questions of \"styles\" or \"schools\" agree in identifying a High Renaissance school of Italian\n\npainting. There is, however, a disagreement, which has seemed nonterminating, regarding Mannerism: Is it another distinct school or\n\nis it merely a late development of the Renaissance school? We believe that this disagreement can be terminated by distinguishing questions of\n\nfact about paintings from questions about the definitions of schools.  To this end we have had two representative subsets of paintings--one\n\nearlier, one later--rated on four of the dimensions of implicit presuppositions that we have introduced in other Working Papers. When\n\nthe paintings are scaled in this way a very distinct profile emerges for the earlier, or Renaissance, paintings. In contrast, the later, or\n\nMannerist, paintings are so heterogeneous that we conclude that they are best described as deviations from the Renaissance profile, rather\n\nthan a separate school. These results are not unimportant--at least for art historians. But they are more important methodologically\n\ninasmuch as the procedures applied here can be used in classifying and distinguishing from one another all kind of cultural products",

The authors propose resolving this disagreement by differentiating factual questions about paintings from definitional questions about schools. They rated two subsets of paintings, an earlier Renaissance group and a later Mannerist group, on four dimensions of implicit presuppositions. Their findings indicate a distinct profile for Renaissance paintings, while Mannerist paintings are highly heterogeneous, suggesting they are better described as deviations from the Renaissance profile rather than a separate school. This methodological approach can be broadly applied to classify other cultural products."

    "title": "The Spiritual Nature of the Italian Renaissance",
    "abstract": "This study seeks to investigate the influence of faith in the emergence and development of the Italian Renaissance, in both the artwork and writing of the major artists and thinkers of the day, and the impact that new expressions of faith had on the viewing public. While the Renaissance is often labeled as a secular movement by modern scholars, this interpretation  is largely due to the political motives of the Medici family who dominated Florence as the center of this artistic rebirth, on and off again throughout the period. On close examination, the philosophical and creative undercurrents of the movement were much more complex. The thinkers of the era would often place Greco-Roman philosophers in the context of their Christian era and use their wisdom in addition to, rather than superseding, church and biblical authority, embracing figures like Virgil and Augustine in concert rather than opposition.  These Christian humanists saw their work as a way to engage humanity in a quest for knowledge in ever expanding ways, but still with an undercurrent of reflection on the role of the divine. Spiritual inquiries of Dante, Lorenzo Valla, and Petrarch in written works are similarly manifested in the visual arts by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarotti, and Raphael Sanzio. These ‘big three’ painters of the Renaissance portrayed their individual Christian ideas through their own writings, sketchbooks, and all forms of artistic expressions, many of which are evaluated in this paper. Finally, the transition of art to a scale inviting the viewer to experience it personally marked a vital change. The shift from divine proportions to more naturalistic and relatable art also logically harmonizes with the mindset of the broader Renaissance movement. This paper seeks to examine the depth and complexity of key Renaissance figures and how concepts of Christian faith and spirituality translated into their works",

Think of the great Library of Alexandria, the burning of which symbolizes the irretrievable loss of knowledge.

It had a dual origin in infection and invention. Infection was the result of the brisk traffic of merchants, scholars, princes, soldiers, Churchmen, and artists which passed between Italy and the North, carrying tidings of the new developments in Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan. In addition, northern Europeans hit on ideas of their own. Since they, like the Italians, were experiencing the growth of trade, urban life, and the centralized state, their response to these events was related to that of the Italians under similar conditions. However, Frenchmen, Germans, Netherlanders, and Englishmen worked with native materials and therefore did not reproduce the Italian scene exactly. [excerpt",

    "summary": "This article examines the involvement of members of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain's early twentieth-century outdoors movement, particularly from 1900-1950. It investigates the Edwardian 'Quaker tramps' and their role in the 'Quaker renaissance,' and Friends' influence on organizations like the Holiday Fellowship and Youth Hostels Association, as well as interwar Quaker mountaineers. The study argues that while early outdoor activities were internal to the Religious Society of Friends, a broader social service vision led Quakers beyond society boundaries in the interwar period, significantly influencing the outdoors movement. These activities promoted the 'social gospel' and represented a crucial aspect of Quaker service during the first half of the twentieth century."

    "abstract": "In the last ten years a number of critical studies on the Harlem Renaissance have been published, and these in turn have sparked a revival of interest in the cultural, political, and social activities that took place during the ten-year period in Afroamerican history between 1919 and 1929. There is a renewed interest in the life and writings of Renaissance figures such as Arna Bontemps, Countee Cullen, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larson, Claude McKay, and Langston Hughes. Hence many of their autobiographies, first published in the 1930s and 1940s, are being reissued in response to the demand for more information on the era when  the Negro was in vogue.  This latest edition of Hughes\\u27s first autobiography The Big Sea is part of this larger revival and follows very closely behind the reprint of his contemporary Zora Neale Hurston\\u27s Dust Tracks on a Road (University of Illinois Press, 1986)",

The book is presented as an insightful study of the era by a contemporary participant, though critics note its lack of personal revelation from Hughes himself. The revival includes reissues of works by other Renaissance figures like Zora Neale Hurston, reflecting a demand for information on this culturally significant period in Afroamerican history. The document also briefly discusses a separate work, \"The Color of God,\" which aims to foster black self-worth but struggles with abstract theological discourse for the average layperson, suggesting a need for concrete examples of African contributions to Christianity."

Blum argues this dynamic is a key achievement of Renaissance thought, exploring how philosophical projects rationalized revelation. The review highlights the book's comprehensive portrayal of Renaissance intellectual endeavors but suggests it overlooks the non-conflictual, hierarchical, and symbiotic articulations between these disciplines prevalent in classical Latin Christianity, where philosophy served to complement theological truth. Key concepts include Fides et Ratio, Renaissance philosophy, and philosophy of religion."

    "title": "Retelling Orpheus: Orpheus in the Renaissance",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the importance of the Orpheus myth during the English Renaissance. The\r\nOrpheus myth was one of the most common mythic intertexts of the period due to the fact\r\nthat we could see the very story of Orpheus as being imbedded within the idea of the\r\nRenaissance itself. The main ambition of the Renaissance humanist was to bring the literature\r\nof the ancients back to life via the means of education. In other words, they attempted to bring\r\nthe dead back to life and Orpheus serves as an embodiment of this ambition due to his ability\r\nto bring inanimate objects to life and in his journey to the underworld to rescue Eurydice. We\r\nfind many different aspects of the Orpheus myth dealt with in Renaissance writing, for\r\nexample Orpheus as poet, Orpheus as lover and the death of Orpheus being some of the key\r\nfocal points. This paper, however, will focus specifically on the role of Orpheus as Poet as, due\r\nto the Renaissance love for art, rhetoric and eloquence, this seems to be the most popular\r\ndimension of the Orpheus myth at that time. We will see how Renaissance writers reinterpret\r\nthe story of Orpheus, as originally told by Ovid and Virgil, in the Metamorphoses and the\r\nGeorgics respectively, to show Orpheus as not only as being an archetypal poet but in fact the\r\nvery first poet whose art is not only responsible for the civilisation of man, but also for the\r\ncreation of a “Golden Age” in Renaissance England",

Minerals during the Renaissance were collected and displayed in wonder rooms to illustrate the beauty of nature. Humanists would have categorized minerals by their external qualities- color, transparency, form, luster, and smell. Over time, geologists continue to study these external qualities when they are first analyzing minerals, and the internal properties. Today the six major factors in identifying minerals are cleavage, the tendency of minerals to break into flat surfaces; color; crystal form or how the form of the mineral changes as the mineral crystallizes; hardness, the resistance to scratching to measure its strength; luster, the light reflection; and streak, the color of the streak left when a mineral is grinded on porcelain.

Still, Camillo was forgotten immediately after his death.

    "abstract": "Among the collections cabinets of the Renaissance, fish, in the forms of naturalia and artificialia, can be widely found. They were sought after for their beauty as well as their relation to the natural world. In the famous frontispiece to Ferrante Imperato’s Dell’historia naturale (1599), fish of varying kinds are hung against and atop the ceiling on either side of a large alligator. They are mixed between an assortment of crustaceans and shells, also sea creatures, including the prized nautilus shell found so abundantly in Renaissance culture. As seen in this frontispiece, fish could be found as decoration in collection cabinets, featured creatures of study in natural history books, and the subject of paintings. The cabinet here at Gettysburg features fish in those two forms of naturalia and artificilia to properly emulate the era. A skeleton of the Gar fish is displayed alongside the skeleton of a Perch. Each representing two sides of the commercial spectrum. Paired with the skeletons are prints of copper engravings done by Mark Catesby (1682-1749) from the second volume of his book The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands (1754).[excerpt",

    "summary": "This paper explores the role of fish, as both naturalia and artificialia, within Renaissance collections cabinets, drawing on examples like Ferrante Imperato's Dell'historia naturale (1599). It highlights how fish were valued for their aesthetic appeal and connection to the natural world, appearing as decorations, subjects of study in natural history books, and in paintings. The Gettysburg cabinet emulates this era by displaying Gar and Perch fish skeletons, representing different commercial values, alongside copper engravings by Mark Catesby from The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands (1754). This study provides insight into Renaissance collecting practices and the representation of nature."

    "summary": "This paper examines how the scope of collections of wonders expanded during the Renaissance, fueled by growing European curiosity. It focuses on three specific East Asian artifacts—the Cricket Cage, Jade Screen, and Iron Dragon—which, though common in their places of origin, were considered marvelous novelties by European collectors. The study explores the cultural perception and significance of these 'small Asian wonders' within the context of early modern European art and intellectual history, highlighting how such items contributed to the evolving understanding of nature and artifice."

This term, renaissance, was used by Mace et al, (2007) in their paper about the urban changes to east Manchester. \n\n\n\nA further term called social rejuvenation is more appropriate because it implies an intervention in the continuing decline of as area without specifying for whom the improvements are intended  thus allowing the market forces to determine the social makeup, and therefore avoiding accusations of letting the locals down through unfulfilled promises. \n\n\n\nThis paper examines in detail both Sydney 2000 and Barcelona 1996 Olympic Games organisers’ strategies in developing their cities in order to host their respective games and in doing so the effects these plans had on the demographic structure of the local populations.

On loan from the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the works of art included in this exhibition examine the topics of war and peace, propaganda, heroism, brutal conflicts, and the harrowing aftermath of battle. Spanning from the Renaissance to the Romantic periods and encompassing a wide geographic scope including Italy, Germany, France, Spain, the Low Countries, England, and North America, the prints depict triumphant Renaissance soldiers, devastating scenes of violence, and satirical caricatures of political figures. Also on display is Goya’s compelling “Disasters of War” series, completed in response to the brutality of the Spanish War of Independence. Goya’s prints serve as a powerful testament to the horrors faced by both soldiers and civilians. Under the direction of Professor Felicia Else and Shannon Egan, Melissa Casale ‘19 and Bailey Harper ‘19 have researched and written didactic labels, catalogue essays, and created an interactive digital interface to complement the exhibition. Together, Melissa and Bailey will lead public tours of the exhibition. A Gallery Talk by Prof. Peter Carmichael will draw connections between the depictions of warfare on view in the Gallery with representations of the American Civil War. James Clifton, Director of the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, will be delivering a lecture in conjunction with the exhibition. Dr. Clifton, who also serves as curator of Renaissance and Baroque painting at MFAH, curated the exhibition in its first iteration and wrote the exhibition catalogue (published by Yale University Press). Dr. Clifton’s lecture not only will provide an overview of the exhibition, but also will focus on the concept of “mediated war.” A full-color catalogue with images and essays by Bailey Harper ’19 and Melissa Casale ’19, under the supervision of Profs. Felicia Else and Shannon Egan, is planned to accompany the exhibition.https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/artcatalogs/1028/thumbnail.jp",

The reviewer notes that Alain Locke's 1925 argument in \"The New Negro\" positioned Black Americans as advancing under their own objectives, aligning with American democratic ideals, especially evident in Harlem. The review critically assesses the book's title and suggests older, finer works exist for students interested in the Harlem Renaissance writers and their historical groundwork for contemporary African American literature."

    "summary": "This entry defines Renaissance classicism as an intellectual movement during the European Renaissance (roughly 1400\n\n1600) that mimicked the literature, rhetoric, art, and philosophy of ancient Rome. It explains that scholars, politicians, and philosophers drew inspiration from classical models, a practice termed classicism. While classical themes existed in medieval Europe, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars, notably Jacob Burckhardt, emphasized the Italian classicists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as the origin of a modern secular worldview, despite some ignoring aspects like religion or warfare. This movement significantly shaped the intellectual life of the period."

Drawing upon theological and philosophical notions of centre in late Medieval and Renaissance culture (specifically Nicolas Cusanus), the study argues that Bramante's drawings for the project reveal a particular understanding of centre, and its constellations of sub-centres, that broadly follow Platonic cosmological principles highlighted in the Timaeus.

    "title": "Between the ideal and the reality: The human body through the eyes of European artists",
    "abstract": "The human body has always been one of the most important subjects for European artists. But the way it is displayed in art has varied in different epochs. In ancient Greece, a canon was constituted that proclaimed an ideal vision of the body, derived from the rules governing the universe. This idealization of the human body, neglected in the Middle Ages, was re‑established in Renaissance and Classicist art. However, Renaissance artists also created another image of the human body by borrowing from patterns mainly found in nature, and started to depict their models not in an ideal but rather in a more natural shape. The new non‑ideal forms of art that appeared in Mannerist art made the artists develop a much wider artistic language, which brought into being a variety of individually interpreted artistic representations of the human body. It preceded similar phenomena which became widespread in the twentieth century. Thus, the human body was not always displayed in art as strong, healthy and beautiful. On the contrary, the martyred bodies of Christ and the saints, as well as the depictions of aged, tired or ill people, also carried enormous artistic expression. A distinct problem has occurred with the ways in which corpses have been presented in art. The review concludes with a reference to the contemporary trend called Body‑Art that involves various artistic activities, such as happenings and performances, where the human body is itself used as a significant work of art",

According to Kenseth’s “A World of Wonders in One Closet Shut,” some collectors believed that fossilized shark’s teeth were “adders’ tongues,” and that they could be used as antidotes to poison.

    "summary": "This study examines the evolving concept of the Renaissance during Goethe's lifetime, noting the absence of a defined epoch concept but the presence of a fluid understanding of the Renaissance in philosophy, historiography, and literature. It traces the development of the Enlightenment's 'renaissance des lettres et des arts' concept, attributing the Italian Renaissance's emergence to events like the Fall of Constantinople or the Crusades, and its connection to the German Reformation. The text highlights a prevailing 18th-century sense of connection to the progressive culture of the Renaissance, predating the clear demarcation of the period established by Michelet and Burckhardt."

A scientific approach has been found in order to reduce the cutting force during machining which is integrating the ultrasonic concept into workpiece. The modelling of vibration cutting ratio has been simulated to find the time force contact and non-contact. Thus, less cutting force could be found.

    "abstract": "It is an oft-repeated cliché that ‘smart is sexy,’ and while cynics may find plenty of reason to scoff at the thought, some solace can be taken in the economic success and increase in the social cachet of the ‘historically informed performance’ (or HIP) movement. Countless millions of people over the last thirty years have been drawn to the world of medieval and renaissance music, many as a result of the exciting new sounds created through the thoughtful synthesis of artistic and intellectual sensibility demonstrated in historical reconstructions of early instruments and their playing techniques. In light of this economic and cultural success, it therefore seems fitting to take a step back and think about how individuals today arrive at a view of historical reality in the world of instrumental performance, especially when faced with images and artifacts which may be interpreted in many different ways. This research, as ‘an authentic expression of our contemporary cultural condition bringing new experiences and insights into our world,’ 1 is immensely valuable. However, are we justified in going further and asserting that our modern reconstructive work sheds light on ‘the way things actually were,’ or in other words, that it reveals objective historical truth? In the following pages I will take a closer look at the research methodology of historically informed performance and propose a refinement based on a probabilistic analysis of the data produced. While the areas of research which might benefit from such an inquiry are virtually unlimited, my specific focus for the purposes of this exercise is the harp technique in late medieval and early renaissance Wales. This is one branch of the musicological tree which remains relatively infrequently visited in early music circles, yet one which, as we will see, is richly rewarding when explored through the multifaceted methodology and interdisciplinary orientation of modern HIP research",

The study specifically focuses on harp technique in late medieval and early renaissance Wales, an under-explored area in early musicology, aiming to provide new insights through interdisciplinary HIP research. Keywords: historically informed performance, historical reconstruction, iconography, early music, harp technique, medieval Wales, renaissance Wales, probabilistic analysis."

    "abstract": "This chapter will consider how the traditional (classical Roman and Europeanmedieval) definition of the “author” as “one worthy of faith” (the faith of thereader, obviously) is put increasingly to the test during the early modern period, as the notion of literary writing gradually moves from epistemological (vatic) and/or ethical-rhetorical models toward what Terry Eagleton has called “the ideology of the aesthetic” – that is, toward suspension of readerly belief in the moral fidelity and intellectual credibility of the literary writer. In a classic formulation, the literary author as a distinctive “personal” and individual presence, indeed as willful demideity “making worlds,” first emerges in what we sometimes still call the Renaissance: first in the Italy of Dante and Petrarch, and then, gradually, spreads throughout the nascent vernacular traditions of western Europe. What follows will rehearse some clichés of the topic, one hopes in an appealing way, and lay out to shift the terms of the discussion in others. In particular, I will focus on the intuitively obvious, yet not always thoroughly explored, point that any notion of authorship is intricately tied to ideas, and realities, of readership. More especially, I will explore, on the one hand, the question of authorial control over the meaning of a text as this takes shape in the experience of its readers and, on the other, how such readers may either trustingly embrace the offered sense of the text or willfully recast it",

    "title": "Lute, Vihuela, and Early Guitar",
    "abstract": "Producción CientíficaLutes, guitars, and vihuelas were the principal plucked instruments in use in Europe until around\r\n1800. Ancient forms of the lute existed in many parts of the ancient world, from Egypt and\r\nPersia through to China. It appears to have become known in Europe, where its earliest\r\nassociations were with immigrants such as the legendary Persian lutenist Ziryab (b. c. 790–d.\r\n852), who was established in Moorish Spain by 822. The origins of the various flat-backed\r\ninstruments that eventually became guitars are more difficult to trace. The vihuela is one such\r\ninstrument that evolved in the mid-15th century and was prolific in Spain and its dominions\r\nthroughout the 16th century and beyond. Very few plucked instruments, and only a handful of\r\nfragmentary musical compositions, survive from before 1500. The absence of artifacts and\r\nmusical sources prior to 1500 has been a point of demarcation in the study of early plucked\r\ninstruments, although current research is seeking to explore the continuity of instrumental\r\npractice across this somewhat artificial divide. In contrast, perhaps as many as thirty thousand\r\nworks—perhaps even more—for lute, guitar, and vihuela survive from the period 1500–1800.\r\nThe music and musical practices associated with them are not well integrated into general\r\nhistories of music. This is due in part to the use of tablature as the principal notation format until\r\nabout 1800, and also because writers of general histories of music have for the most part\r\nignored solo instrumental music in their coverage. (For example, the Oxford Anthology of\r\nWestern Music, Vol. 1 (2018), designed to accompany chapters 1–11 of Richard Taruskin’s\r\nOxford History of Western Music, does not contain a single piece of instrumental music prior to\r\nFrescobaldi [1637]). Contrary to this marginalized image, lutes, vihuelas, and guitars were a\r\nrevered part of courtly musical culture until well into the 18th century, and constantly present in\r\nurban contexts. After the development of basso continuo practice after 1600, plucked\r\ninstruments also became frequent in Christian church music, although the lute was widely\r\nplayed by clerics of all levels, particularly during the Renaissance. It was also one of the\r\nprincipal tools used by composers of liturgical polyphony, in part because tablature was the\r\nmost common way of writing music in score. From the beginning of music printing, printed\r\ntablatures played a fundamental role in the urban dissemination of music originally for church\r\nand court, and plucked instruments were used widely by all levels of society for both leisure and\r\npleasure. After 1800, the lute fell from use, the guitar was transformed into its modern form with\r\nsingle strings, and tablature ceased to be the preferred notation for plucked instruments.Este trabajo forma parte del proyecto de investigación “La obra musical renacentista: fundamentos, repertorios y prácticas” HAR 2015-70181-P (MINECO/FEDER, UE",

According to Paul Oskar Kristeller, rhetoric was an important basis of Renaissance humanism. Students learned tropes and other figures of speech from well-circulated classical texts such as the Rhetorica ad Herennium and Quintilian’s Institutio oratorio. Examples of tropic devices can be found in works such as Giulio Romano’s Palazzo del Te and Michelangelo’s Porta Pia.

Au fil de son histoire, cet animal a fini par former un tout avec la tradition des éditions de la Renaissance, qui ont hérité de son sens symbolique principal.The Renaissance tradition considered the Gulo (Wolverine) as a symbolic animal, representing the glutton, with specific reference to populations from Northern Europe. The animal's image developed into rich written and oral traditions, and its main symbolic meaning translated into the Renaissance",

    "summary": "This article examines the symbolic representation of the Gulo (wolverine) in Renaissance tradition, particularly its association with gluttony and Northern European populations. The study traces the animal's ancient image through diverse written and oral traditions, both cultivated and popular, demonstrating how its primary symbolic meaning was integrated into Renaissance editions. The research highlights the Gulo's role in Renaissance symbolism, connecting it to historical depictions of vices and other symbolic animals. This work is valuable for understanding the cultural and symbolic interpretations of animals during the Renaissance period."

    "summary": "This paper analyzes Vincenzo Galilei's lute arrangements of Alessandro Striggio's \"Nasce la pena mia\" within the context of sixteenth-century solo lute music. It revises interpretive conclusions based on Jean-Michel Vaccaro's classification and Canguilhem's taxonomy of imitation, informed by Renaissance literary theory. The study applies new interpretive principles to Galilei's three lute versions, comparing them to his other works and his own precepts for vocal model arrangements for solo lute. Findings aim to significantly contribute to the critical interpretation of Renaissance instrumental music, focusing on parody, intabulation, and derived fantasias."

    "title": "Banks and development : Jewish communities in the Italian Renaissance and current economic performance",
    "abstract": "Are differences in local banking development long-lasting? Do they affect long-term economic performance?\n\nI answer these questions by relying on an historical development that occurred in Italian cities during the 15th\n\ncentury. A sudden change in the Catholic doctrine had driven the Jews toward money lending. Cities that\n\nwere hosting Jewish communities developed complex banking institutions for two reasons: first, the Jews were\n\nthe only people in Italy who were allowed to lend for a profit and, second, the Franciscan reaction to Jewish\n\nusury led to the creation of charity lending institutions, the Monti di Pietá, that have survived until today and\n\nhave become the basis of the Italian banking system. Using Jewish demography in 1500 as an instrument, I\n\nprovide evidence of (1) an extraordinary persistence in the level of banking development across Italian cities (2)\n\nlarge effects of current local banking development on per-capita income. Additional firm-level analyses suggest\n\nthat well-functioning local banks exert large effects on aggregate productivity by reallocating resources toward\n\nmore efficient firms. I exploit the expulsion of the Jews from the Spanish territories in Italy in 1541 to argue\n\nthat my results are not driven by omitted institutional, cultural and geographical characteristics. In particular,\n\nI show that, in Central Italy, the difference in current income between cities that hosted Jewish communities\n\nand cities that did not exists only in those regions that were not Spanish territories in the 16th century",

It traces the origins of Scott's methodologies, which adapted Bernard Berenson's art historical analytical methods like space-composition and life-enhancement from Renaissance painting to architecture. The study highlights Scott's recognition in English aesthetic circles versus his neglect in Continental Europe, focusing on the limited influence of his book, \"The Architecture of Humanism\" (1914). The analysis reveals how Zevi became the crucial figure in introducing and interpreting Scott's ideas, thereby bridging an academic divide and broadening their impact on architectural discourse."

It highlights his methodology of selecting and copying source fragments, with originality stemming from his selection and compilation choices, particularly in cartography. The study reveals Lambert's connection to the twelfth-century renaissance, sharing interests in natural philosophy with contemporaries like Adelard of Bath and William of Conches. His visual language, particularly in mappae mundi, integrated cosmographical knowledge from Isidore of Seville and Bede, bridging classical exegesis with contemporary scientific thought, while carefully aligning with Church teachings. His work, Liber Floridus, is an encyclopedia and significant for its selection of sources, its imagery, and its contribution to twelfth-century scholastic culture."
